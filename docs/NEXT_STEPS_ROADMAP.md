## Development Guidelines

### 1. Module Development Checklist
```markdown
For each module:
- [ ] Create GraphQL schema in `src/graphql/schema.graphql`
- [ ] Implement entities with TypeORM decorations
- [ ] Create GraphQL resolvers with federation support
- [ ] Add REST controllers for legacy support
- [ ] Implement service layer with business logic
- [ ] Add Bangladesh-specific validations
- [ ] Create unit and integration tests
- [ ] Update module's CLAUDE.md documentation
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Configure OpenTelemetry tracing
```

### 2. Bangladesh Compliance Checklist
```markdown
For finance/HR modules:
- [ ] VAT calculation at 15%
- [ ] Withholding tax by vendor type
- [ ] TIN format: 10 digits
- [ ] BIN format: 9 digits
- [ ] NID format: 10/13/17 digits
- [ ] Mobile: 01[3-9]-XXXXXXXX
- [ ] Fiscal year: July-June
- [ ] NBR report formats
- [ ] Bengali language support for reports
```

### 3. Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Standard module structure
services/
  module-name/
    src/
      entities/        # TypeORM entities
      graphql/        # GraphQL resolvers & schema
      controllers/    # REST endpoints
      services/       # Business logic
      events/         # Kafka event handlers
      workflows/      # Temporal workflows
      validators/     # Bangladesh-specific validation
    test/
    CLAUDE.md         # Module documentation
```

## Testing Strategy

### Local Development Testing
```bash
# 1. Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# 2. Verify services
curl http://localhost:3000/health     # Check service health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health  # GraphQL health

# 3. Run module tests
cd services/finance
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# 4. Check monitoring
open http://localhost:3000  # Grafana dashboards
open http://localhost:8088  # Temporal workflows
```

### Integration Testing
```bash
# Run cross-module tests
npm run test:integration

# Test GraphQL federation
npm run test:federation

# Load testing
npm run test:performance
```

## Deployment Process

### Development Environment
```bash
# 1. Build service
cd services/finance
npm run build

# 2. Build Docker image
docker build -t vextrus/finance-service:dev .

# 3. Deploy locally
docker-compose up -d finance

# 4. Verify deployment
curl http://localhost:3005/health
```

### Staging/Production
```bash
# 1. Push to feature branch
git push origin feature/finance-module

# 2. CI/CD pipeline automatically:
#    - Runs tests
#    - Builds Docker images
#    - Deploys to staging
#    - Runs smoke tests

# 3. Create PR for review
gh pr create --title "Finance Module Implementation"

# 4. After approval, merge to main
# 5. Automatic production deployment
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track
```yaml
Finance Module:
  - Transaction processing time < 500ms
  - Invoice generation < 2s
  - Report generation < 10s
  - VAT calculation accuracy 100%

HR Module:
  - Payroll processing < 30s per 100 employees
  - Leave approval workflow < 1 hour
  - Employee data query < 200ms

System Wide:
  - API response time < 300ms (p95)
  - Database query time < 100ms
  - Error rate < 0.1%
  - Uptime > 99.9%
```

## Common Commands Reference

```bash
# Service development
cd services/<module>
npm run dev              # Start in dev mode
npm run test            # Run tests
npm run build           # Build for production

# Infrastructure management
docker-compose up -d     # Start all services
docker ps | grep vextrus # Check running services
docker logs <service>    # View service logs

# Database operations
npm run migration:create  # Create new migration
npm run migration:run     # Run migrations
npm run seed             # Seed test data

# Monitoring
open http://localhost:3000      # Grafana
open http://localhost:8088      # Temporal UI
open http://localhost:9090      # Prometheus

# Workflow testing
cd services/workflow
npm run temporal:worker  # Start worker
npm run temporal:execute # Execute test workflow
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Performance**: Add indexes early, use query optimization
2. **Memory Leaks**: Monitor with Grafana, set resource limits
3. **API Rate Limiting**: Implement from start in API Gateway
4. **Data Validation**: Use strong typing and validation layers

### Business Risks
1. **Compliance**: Regular NBR/RAJUK regulation reviews
2. **Data Security**: Implement encryption at rest and in transit
3. **Audit Trail**: Ensure complete transaction tracking
4. **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with tested restore

## Support Resources

### Documentation
- API Docs: `http://localhost:4000/graphql` (GraphQL Playground)
- Architecture: `docs/adr/`
- Service Docs: `services/*/CLAUDE.md`

### Troubleshooting
- Logs: `docker logs vextrus-<service>`
- Metrics: Grafana dashboards
- Tracing: Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`
- Health: `curl http://localhost:<port>/health`

## Next Immediate Actions

1. **Choose First Module**: Recommend starting with Finance
2. **Create Task File**:
   ```bash
   cp sessions/tasks/TEMPLATE.md sessions/tasks/h-implement-finance-module.md
   ```
3. **Set Up Development Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/finance-module
   ```
4. **Start Implementation**: Follow the module development checklist

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. Which module has the highest business priority?
2. Are there specific Bangladesh regulations we need to research?
3. Do we have sample data for testing (chart of accounts, tax rates)?
4. Are there existing systems we need to integrate with?
5. What's the target go-live date for the first module?
