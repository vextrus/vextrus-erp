# MCP Server Analysis for Vextrus ERP

## Current Status

### MCP Servers Configured but Not Connected
After thorough investigation, the MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are:

1. **Configured** in `.mcp.json` with API keys and settings
2. **Enabled** in `.claude/settings.local.json` 
3. **Some installed globally** (playwright, context7, consult-llm)
4. **NOT available** as callable tools in Claude's interface

### Technical Finding
MCP servers require a bridge/adapter to connect to Claude's tool system. They are external processes that need to be:
- Started as separate services
- Connected through stdio/websocket
- Registered with Claude's tool interface

This bridge is not currently active, which is why we can't access them as tools.

## Available Alternatives for Research

### Built-in Tools We Can Use

| Research Need | MCP Server (Not Available) | Alternative Tool (Available) |
|---------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Web Search | brave-search | WebSearch |
| Documentation | context7, memory | Write to markdown files |
| Code Intelligence | serena | Read, Grep, Glob |
| Database | postgres, sqlite | Bash with CLI tools |
| Git Operations | github | Bash git commands |
| Web Scraping | brightdata, playwright | WebFetch |
| Note Taking | notion | Markdown files |
| Community Research | reddit | WebSearch |

## Research Strategy Without MCP

### 1. Web Research
- Use `WebSearch` for finding latest patterns and practices
- Use `WebFetch` for extracting content from specific URLs
- Store findings in markdown documentation

### 2. Code Analysis
- Use `Grep` for searching patterns in codebase
- Use `Glob` for finding files
- Use `Read` for examining code examples

### 3. Documentation Management
- Create structured markdown files in `docs/research/`
- Maintain session logs in `sessions/`
- Store context in `.claude/state/`

### 4. Database Operations
```bash
# PostgreSQL
psql -U user -d database -c "SELECT * FROM tables;"

# SQLite
sqlite3 database.db "SELECT * FROM tables;"

# MongoDB
mongosh --eval "db.collection.find()"
```

## Research Topics for Vextrus ERP

Based on our findings, here are the critical areas we've already researched:

### âœ… Completed Research
1. **Bangladesh Market**: $30B construction industry, 8-10% growth
2. **Tech Stack**: NestJS + PostgreSQL + Redis + Kafka
3. **Architecture**: Modular monolith â†’ Microservices migration
4. **Competition**: Primavera P6 weaknesses identified
5. **Local Requirements**: Bengali, bKash/Nagad, RAJUK, NBR

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Deep Research
1. **Performance Optimization** for slow internet (23.3 Mbps avg)
2. **Offline-First Architecture** for field workers
3. **Multi-Currency Handling** with BDT focus
4. **Government Integration APIs** (RAJUK ECPS details)
5. **Security Compliance** for Bangladesh Data Protection Act

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue with Available Tools
- Use WebSearch for market research
- Use Read/Write for documentation
- Use Bash for system operations
- Build comprehensive documentation locally

### Option 2: Manual MCP Setup (Advanced)
1. Install MCP servers locally
2. Create bridge service to connect to Claude
3. Register as custom tools
4. Test connectivity

### Option 3: Focus on Implementation
Since we have sufficient research, we can:
1. Create first development task
2. Set up Docker environment
3. Initialize NestJS project
4. Start building with what we know

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Option 3** - We have enough research to start building. The key findings are:

- **Market opportunity** is clear
- **Tech stack** is defined
- **Architecture pattern** is chosen
- **Local requirements** are understood

We can continue researching specific details as we build each module.

**Decision Point**: Should we create the first development task and start building the foundation?
