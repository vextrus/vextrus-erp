# CLAUDE.md v4.0 - Archived

**Version**: 4.0 (Agentic Workflow)
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Archived**: 2025-10-16 (same day - experimental iteration)
**Replaced By**: v5.0
**Lines**: 233
**Reason for Archive**: Lacked sessions protocol integration

---

**v4.0 Features**:
- Ultra-concise (233 lines, down from 515)
- Plugin-first approach with 41 plugins
- Clear agent orchestration (Sonnet 4.5 + Haiku 4.5)
- Removed Bangladesh compliance details
- Removed version history
- Essential commands only

**Why v5.0**:
v4.0 was excellent for simple tasks but lacked integration with the proven sessions system (91 files, 30+ completed tasks). v5.0 preserves v4.0's conciseness (401 lines) while adding:
- Sessions protocol references (complex task workflows)
- Compounding-engineering integration (17 agents)
- 107 agents documented (not just 41 plugins)
- Context optimization guidance
- Task file size limits
- Complete workflow integration

**Historical Note**:
v4.0 was created as part of comprehensive workflow analysis. It successfully streamlined documentation but was immediately superseded when sessions folder research revealed the need for protocol integration. v4.0 lived for only a few hours as an experimental iteration.
