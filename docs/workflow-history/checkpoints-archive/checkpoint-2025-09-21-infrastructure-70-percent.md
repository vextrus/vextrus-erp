# Infrastructure Foundation Checkpoint - Session End
## Date: 2025-09-21
## Task: h-complete-infrastructure-foundation
## Overall Progress: 70% Complete

## ✅ Completed Items

### Infrastructure Services (100%)
- ✅ PostgreSQL - Running and healthy
- ✅ Redis - Running and healthy
- ✅ Elasticsearch - Running and healthy
- ✅ Kafka - Running (Zookeeper port issue fixed)
- ✅ Zookeeper - Running (removed external port)
- ✅ Temporal - Running
- ✅ SignOz ClickHouse - Running
- ✅ SignOz OTEL Collector - Running (replaced old collector)
- ✅ MinIO - Running and healthy
- ✅ Adminer, Redis Commander, Kafka UI - All running

### Database Setup (100%)
- ✅ All 19 service databases created
- ✅ Proper schemas and extensions configured
- ✅ User permissions granted

### Docker Configuration (100%)
- ✅ Created universal-service.Dockerfile
- ✅ Added 6 new services to docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Fixed package name references (@vextrus/kernel)
- ✅ Updated pnpm-lock.yaml

### New Services Setup (80%)
- ✅ Created package.json for all 6 new services
- ✅ Created basic service structure (main.ts, app.module.ts, health.controller.ts)
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript configurations (commonjs module)
- ✅ Created tsconfig.json, nest-cli.json, tsconfig.build.json
- ⚠️ Docker builds in progress (taking time due to dependencies)

## 🔧 Current Issues

### Critical Issues
1. **API Gateway** - Restarting loop
   - Cannot connect to auth service at http://localhost:3001/graphql
   - Needs service discovery configuration

2. **Workflow Service** - Restarting loop
   - TypeScript compilation errors in invoice-approval.workflow.ts
   - Duration type mismatches

3. **Health Endpoints** - All returning 404
   - Services running but health endpoints not accessible
   - Port mapping may not be working correctly

### Service Status
- ✅ Running: auth, audit, configuration, notification, master-data, rules-engine
- ⚠️ Starting: Various services still building
- ❌ Restarting: api-gateway, workflow

## 📋 Next Session Tasks

### Immediate Priority
1. Fix workflow service TypeScript errors
2. Fix API Gateway service discovery
3. Verify port mappings in docker-compose.yml
4. Test health endpoints from within Docker network

### Then Continue With
5. Complete startup of new services (CRM, Finance, HR, Organization, Project Management, SCM)
6. Verify all health checks passing
7. Set up monitoring dashboards
8. Configure API documentation
9. Run validation test suite

## 📝 Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check service status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep vextrus

# Fix workflow service
docker exec -it vextrus-workflow bash
# Then fix TypeScript errors in invoice-approval.workflow.ts

# Test internal connectivity
docker exec vextrus-api-gateway curl http://auth:3001/health

# Check logs
docker logs vextrus-api-gateway --tail 50
docker logs vextrus-workflow --tail 50

# Once fixed, restart services
docker-compose restart api-gateway workflow

# Continue with new services
docker-compose up -d crm finance hr organization project-management scm
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics Progress

| Metric | Status | Progress |
|--------|--------|----------|
| All services containerized | ✅ | 100% |
| Databases initialized | ✅ | 100% |
| Health checks passing | ❌ | 0% |
| Monitoring accessible | ⚠️ | 50% (SignOz running) |
| API documentation | ❌ | 0% |
| Tests passing | ❌ | 0% |

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Port Conflicts**: Windows has restrictions on certain ports (2181), requiring internal-only exposure
2. **TypeScript Config**: New NestJS services need `module: "commonjs"` not ES modules
3. **Service Dependencies**: API Gateway needs proper service discovery configuration
4. **Build Time**: Full service builds with dependencies take significant time
5. **Health Endpoints**: Need to verify routes are properly configured in each service

## 🔄 Recovery Script Created

`recover-infrastructure.sh` - Use this after Docker restart to bring everything back up in correct order

*Session ended with 70% infrastructure complete. Core services running but need fixes for health checks and service discovery.*
