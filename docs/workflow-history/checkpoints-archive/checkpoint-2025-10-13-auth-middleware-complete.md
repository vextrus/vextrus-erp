## What Remains To Be Done

### Priority 1: Reach 100% Authentication (4-6 hours)
Apply `@UseGuards(GqlAuthGuard)` to sensitive resolvers:
1. **Identify sensitive operations** in each service:
   - User-specific data queries (myOrders, myProfile)
   - Data mutation operations (create, update, delete)
   - Admin-only operations (deleteAll, systemConfig)
2. **Apply guard pattern** to each resolver:
   ```typescript
   @Query(() => Order)
   @UseGuards(GqlAuthGuard)
   async myOrders(@CurrentUser() user: CurrentUserContext) {
     return this.orderService.findByUserId(user.id);
   }
   ```
3. **Services to update**: Auth, Master Data, Organization, Finance, Workflow, Rules Engine (6 services)
4. **Test each service** to verify 401 responses for unauthenticated requests

### Priority 2: Frontend Integration Documentation (4-6 hours)
Create comprehensive guide for frontend team:
1. **API Gateway usage patterns**
   - GraphQL endpoint: http://localhost:4000/graphql
   - Authentication flow with JWT tokens
   - Query examples for each service
2. **Authentication implementation**
   - Login mutation example
   - Token storage (httpOnly cookies recommended)
   - Token refresh flow
   - Error handling patterns
3. **Query patterns per service**
   - Master data queries
   - User profile management
   - Order management
   - Financial transactions
4. **Error handling guidelines**
   - Network errors
   - Authentication failures
   - Validation errors
   - Server errors

### Priority 3: Complete Observability (100%) (6-8 hours)
#### Grafana Dashboards
- Service health dashboard (CPU, memory, response times)
- GraphQL operations dashboard (query rates, error rates)
- Authentication dashboard (login attempts, token validation)
- Business metrics dashboard (orders, transactions, users)

#### Performance Baselines
- Establish baseline metrics for each service
- Document acceptable performance ranges
- Set up automated performance regression detection

#### Alerting Rules
- Service down alerts (Slack/email)
- High error rate alerts (> 5%)
- Performance degradation alerts (response time > 1s)
- Authentication failure spike alerts

#### SLA Monitoring
- 99.9% uptime target
- < 500ms response time target
- Error rate < 1% target
- Dashboard showing SLA compliance

#### End-to-End Tracing Verification
- Verify traces flow from API Gateway → Subgraphs
- Check SignOz dashboard (http://localhost:3301)
- Validate trace correlation across services
- Document trace IDs in logs

### Priority 4: Fix Document Generator Health (1-2 hours)
- Investigate unhealthy status cause
- Fix health check implementation
- Verify database connections
- Test document generation functionality

### Priority 5: Technical Debt Cleanup (As Needed)
- Standardize health endpoints across all services
- Migrate remaining services to use shared PageInfo package
- Implement environment-based CSRF configuration
- Review and update service dependencies

## Blockers & Considerations

### No Critical Blockers
- All infrastructure is operational
- Authentication infrastructure is ready
- Documentation is comprehensive

### Considerations for Next Session
1. **Service Selection for Guards**: Start with critical services (Auth, Finance, Organization) for maximum security impact
2. **Frontend Team Coordination**: Frontend guide needs input on preferred GraphQL client (Apollo, urql, etc.)
3. **Observability Tools**: SignOz already running, need to configure dashboards
4. **Document Generator**: Low priority - service functional despite health check failure

---

## Next Concrete Steps

### Immediately After Context Clear:

**Step 1: Apply Authentication Guards (4-6 hours)**
1. Start with Auth service resolvers (me, updateProfile, changePassword)
2. Move to Finance service resolvers (myTransactions, createInvoice)
3. Apply to Organization service (myOrganization, updateOrganization)
4. Test with integration tests to verify 401 responses

**Step 2: Frontend Integration Guide (4-6 hours)**
1. Create `docs/guides/FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Document API Gateway endpoint and authentication flow
3. Provide query examples for all 13 services
4. Include error handling patterns and best practices

**Step 3: Observability Configuration (6-8 hours)**
1. Create Grafana dashboards from templates
2. Establish performance baselines for all services
3. Configure alerting rules in Prometheus
4. Verify end-to-end tracing in SignOz
5. Create SLA monitoring dashboard

**Step 4: Fix Document Generator (1-2 hours)**
1. Check health endpoint implementation
2. Verify database and dependency connections
3. Test document generation with sample data
