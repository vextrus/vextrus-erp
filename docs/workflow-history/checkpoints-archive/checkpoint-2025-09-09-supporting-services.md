# Context Compaction Checkpoint - Supporting Services Foundation
Date: 2025-09-09
Task: h-implement-supporting-services

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented Services (100%)
1. **Notification Service** (Port 3003)
   - Multi-channel support (Email, SMS, Push)
   - Bangladesh SMS providers integration (Alpha SMS, SMS.NET.BD)
   - International SMS via Twilio
   - Bull queue processors for async operations
   - Bulk notification support with progress tracking
   - Complete DTOs, entities, controllers, services

2. **Configuration Service** (Port 3004) 
   - Feature flag entity with tenant/user targeting
   - Dynamic configuration management
   - Consul/etcd provider support
   - Redis caching layer

### üîß Services with Basic Structure (Need Completion)
3. **Scheduler Service** (Port 3005) - main.ts only
4. **Document Generator Service** (Port 3006) - main.ts only  
5. **Import/Export Service** (Port 3007) - main.ts only
6. **File Storage Service** (Port 3008) - main.ts only
7. **Audit Service** (Port 3009) - main.ts only

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Completed
- Full Docker Compose configuration
- All supporting services configured (Elasticsearch, MinIO, Consul, RabbitMQ)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Service discovery and configuration management

## What Remains To Be Done

For each partially implemented service, need to create:
1. **app.module.ts** - Complete module configuration with dependencies
2. **Controllers** - REST API endpoints
3. **Services** - Business logic implementation
4. **DTOs** - Data transfer objects
5. **Entities** - Database entities
6. **Providers** - External service integrations
7. **Health checks** - Monitoring endpoints

## Key Discoveries During Implementation
- Bengali Unicode handling requires special character detection
- SMS segment calculation differs for Bengali (70 chars) vs English (160 chars)
- Bull queue processors need separate classes from main services
- Feature flags require complex rule evaluation logic
- Each notification channel needs dedicated provider classes with fallback

## Next Concrete Steps

### Priority Order:
1. **Scheduler Service** - Critical for batch jobs and scheduled tasks
2. **File Storage Service** - Required by multiple modules for document handling
3. **Document Generator Service** - Needed for invoices and reports
4. **Audit Service** - Required for compliance tracking
5. **Import/Export Service** - Needed for data migration

### For Each Service:
```bash
cd services/{service-name}
pnpm install
# Create app.module.ts with proper imports
# Implement controllers, services, DTOs, entities
# Add health check module
# Test with docker-compose up
```

## Environment Variables Needed
Each service requires:
- Database connection (DATABASE_*)
- Redis connection (REDIS_*)
- Kafka brokers (KAFKA_BROKERS)
- Service-specific configs (e.g., MINIO_* for file-storage)

## No Blockers
All dependencies are available and infrastructure is ready. Just need to complete the implementation of remaining services following the established patterns from Notification and Configuration services.

Ready for context compaction and continuation in fresh session.
