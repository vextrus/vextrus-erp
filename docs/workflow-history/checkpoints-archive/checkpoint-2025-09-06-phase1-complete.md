# Context Checkpoint - 2025-09-06

## Current State
**Task**: h-integrate-opentelemetry-observability  
**Branch**: feature/opentelemetry-integration  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Ready for Phase 2

## What Was Accomplished - Phase 1 ✅
✅ Installed OpenTelemetry packages with compatible versions
✅ Created telemetry.ts initialization with SDK setup
✅ Updated main.ts with proper import order (telemetry first!)
✅ Created TelemetryModule with TracingInterceptor
✅ Built custom @Trace() decorator for business methods
✅ Integrated TelemetryModule into AppModule with global interceptor
✅ Added custom spans to all auth service methods (login, register, refresh, logout)
✅ Verified service startup with telemetry enabled
✅ Tested trace generation with health and auth endpoints
✅ Restarted SigNoz stack for trace collection

## What Remains - Phase 2
- [ ] Add metrics collection and custom business metrics
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing context propagation
- [ ] Create shared observability utilities in @vextrus/utils
- [ ] Update service template with observability by default
- [ ] Configure SigNoz dashboards for auth service
- [ ] Add performance monitoring metrics
- [ ] Implement error tracking and alerting

## Key Technical Decisions
- Used OpenTelemetry SDK with auto-instrumentation for NestJS
- Implemented decorator pattern for clean business logic instrumentation
- Required telemetry initialization before NestJS bootstrap for proper functionality
- Created modular TelemetryModule for easy integration
- Added security-aware span attributes (avoiding sensitive data)

## Files Created/Modified
- `services/auth/src/telemetry.ts` - SDK initialization
- `services/auth/src/telemetry/telemetry.module.ts` - TracingInterceptor & TracingService
- `services/auth/src/telemetry/decorators/trace.decorator.ts` - @Trace() decorator
- `services/auth/src/main.ts` - Added telemetry import first
- `services/auth/src/app.module.ts` - Integrated TelemetryModule
- `services/auth/src/modules/auth/auth.service.ts` - Added @Trace() to all methods

## Next Concrete Steps
1. Create MetricsService in TelemetryModule for custom metrics
2. Add authentication metrics (login attempts, success rates)
3. Implement context propagation headers for distributed tracing
4. Create @vextrus/observability shared library
5. Test distributed tracing with multiple services

## Trigger Prompt for Next Session
```
Continue with Phase 2 of the h-integrate-opentelemetry-observability task.
Start by adding custom metrics collection to the auth service, including:
- Login attempt counters (success/failure)
- Token refresh rate metrics
- Response time histograms
- Active session gauges
Then proceed with distributed tracing context propagation.
