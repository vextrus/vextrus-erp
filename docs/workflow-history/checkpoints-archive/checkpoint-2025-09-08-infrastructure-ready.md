# Context Compaction Checkpoint - 2025-09-08
## Task: h-implement-critical-infrastructure

### ‚úÖ Session Accomplishments
- **Research Phase Complete**: Deep technical research on Traefik v3.5, PostgreSQL RLS, Docker Secrets
- **Industry Analysis**: Bangladesh construction/real estate sector (Concord, Navana, Edison, Bashundhara, Shanta)
- **Architecture Designed**: Construction-specific organization hierarchy and multi-tenancy approach
- **Implementation Plan**: 10-day roadmap tailored for construction ERP

### üéØ Key Discoveries
- **Industry Focus**: This is specifically a Bangladesh Construction & Real Estate ERP
- **Organization Structure**: Organization ‚Üí Divisions ‚Üí Projects ‚Üí Project Sites ‚Üí Departments
- **Technical Decisions**: 
  - Header-based multi-tenancy (X-Tenant-ID, X-Project-ID, X-Site-ID)
  - Let's Encrypt for SSL
  - Zero-downtime migration strategy

### üìã What Remains
- Day 1: Deploy Traefik v3.5 with basic routing
- Day 2: Complete Traefik configuration and service discovery
- Day 3-4: Implement Docker Secrets and HTTPS
- Day 5: PostgreSQL RLS implementation
- Week 2: Organization Service and integration

### üöÄ Next Concrete Steps
1. Switch to implementation mode (DAIC)
2. Deploy Traefik service in docker-compose.yml
3. Configure basic HTTP routing on port 80
4. Set up service discovery with Docker labels
5. Integrate auth service with Traefik routing

### üìù Ready for Implementation
All research complete. Context refinement and logging agents have processed the session. Ready to clear context and begin implementation.

## Prompt for Next Session
```
./daic implementation
Switch to implementation mode and begin Day 1 of the critical infrastructure implementation for Bangladesh construction/real estate ERP. Deploy Traefik v3.5 API Gateway with:
1. Basic HTTP routing on port 80
2. Docker provider for service discovery
3. Dashboard on port 8080
4. Integration with existing auth service on port 3001
5. Use the construction-specific plan with header-based multi-tenancy (X-Tenant-ID)
