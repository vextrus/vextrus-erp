# Context Checkpoint - Shared Libraries Packaging
Date: 2025-09-06
Task: h-package-shared-libraries
Branch: feature/optimize-foundation (actual) vs feature/package-shared-libraries (expected)

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

### Shared Library Packaging Complete
1. **Created Three Core Packages:**
   - `@vextrus/kernel` - Domain primitives with TypeScript compilation
   - `@vextrus/contracts` - Service contracts and interfaces
   - `@vextrus/utils` - Utility functions

2. **Build System Integration:**
   - Configured Turbo v2 with proper `tasks` field (not `pipeline`)
   - Added `packageManager: "npm@10.0.0"` to root package.json
   - Set up TypeScript project references for incremental builds
   - All packages building successfully with proper dist outputs

3. **Monorepo Configuration:**
   - Updated `tsconfig.base.json` paths from `@shared/*` to `@vextrus/*`
   - Fixed workspace resolution for npm workspaces
   - Service template generator updated to use new imports

4. **Verification:**
   - All packages built successfully with Turbo
   - Type checking passes without errors
   - Auth service dependencies updated and working

## üìù What Remains To Be Done

### Documentation Updates Required
- [ ] Document shared library packaging implementation
- [ ] Update development workflow documentation  
- [ ] Create monorepo best practices guide
- [ ] Update README with new package structure
- [ ] Document Turbo build pipeline
- [ ] Update service template documentation
- [ ] Create MCP server usage guide
- [ ] Update task completion checklist

## üîë Key Discoveries
- Turbo v2 requires `tasks` not `pipeline` in turbo.json
- npm workspaces use `^1.0.0` not `workspace:*` syntax
- TypeScript project references significantly improve build performance
- Service integration was smooth with proper package exports

## üöÄ Next Concrete Steps
1. Clear context and restart session
2. Execute documentation updates systematically
3. Focus on critical docs first: README, development workflow
4. Create new monorepo best practices guide with lessons learned
5. Update service template documentation last

## Technical Notes
- Shared libraries are fully functional and tested
- Build pipeline is optimized with proper dependency ordering
- No blockers for Phase 1 development to proceed
