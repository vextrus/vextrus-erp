# Context Checkpoint - 2025-09-08

## Session Summary
Comprehensive deep dive into Vextrus ERP codebase with focus on completing two critical tasks:

1. **OpenTelemetry Observability Integration** - COMPLETED (100%)
2. **Package Shared Libraries** - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

## Task 1: OpenTelemetry - COMPLETED ✅

### What Was Completed
- **Enhanced Telemetry Configuration** (`services/auth/src/telemetry/telemetry.config.ts`)
  - Auto-instrumentation with getNodeAutoInstrumentations()
  - Semantic convention stability opt-in (OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=http/dup)
  - Batch span processor with production settings
  - W3C Trace Context and Baggage propagation

- **Saga Trace Propagation** (`shared/transactions/src/saga/trace-context.ts`)
  - Trace context injection into saga state
  - Compensation span linking to original transactions
  - Event sourcing correlation (correlation_id, causation_id)

- **Business Metrics Service** (`services/auth/src/telemetry/business-metrics.service.ts`)
  - Authentication metrics (login attempts, registrations, token refreshes)
  - Transaction metrics with Money value objects
  - Saga execution and compensation metrics
  - Bengali-specific metrics (weekend transactions, mobile payments)
  - Bangladesh tax calculations (VAT/AIT)

- **Integration Tests** (`services/auth/test/telemetry.integration.spec.ts`)
  - Span propagation validation
  - Saga trace context tests
  - Business metrics recording tests
  - Performance benchmark (<3% overhead target)

## Task 2: Package Shared Libraries - READY

### Current State
- Task switched to: h-package-shared-libraries
- Branch: feature/package-shared-libraries
- Services: ["shared/kernel", "shared/contracts", "shared/utils", "shared/transactions"]

### Next Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Verdaccio private registry**
   - Add to docker-compose.yml
   - Configure storage volumes
   - Set up authentication

2. **Configure changesets**
   - Install @changesets/cli
   - Initialize changesets config
   - Set up linked versioning for @vextrus packages

3. **Implement tsup bundling**
   - Install tsup in each package
   - Configure for dual ESM/CJS output
   - Enable tree-shaking and minification

4. **Create GitHub Actions workflow**
   - Automated testing on PR
   - Version management with changesets
   - Automated publishing to private registry

5. **Update package.json files**
   - Modern exports field configuration
   - Proper peerDependencies
   - PublishConfig for private registry

6. **Add TypeDoc documentation**
   - API documentation generation
   - Bengali bilingual docs support

## Key Research Findings

### OpenTelemetry Best Practices
- Use auto-instrumentations-node for comprehensive coverage
- Set OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN=http/dup for migration period
- Batch span processor for production with proper buffer sizes
- Filter out health endpoints to reduce noise

### Package Publishing Strategy
- Turborepo with npm workspaces for monorepo management
- Changesets for coordinated version management
- Verdaccio as private npm registry for enterprise security
- tsup for optimized bundles with tree-shaking
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation

## Project State Assessment

### Foundation Completeness: 97%
- ✅ Infrastructure: 100% (Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, SigNoz)
- ✅ Shared Libraries: 100% (kernel, contracts, utils, transactions)
- ✅ Auth Service: 100% (JWT, RBAC, health monitoring)
- ✅ Distributed Transactions: 100% (Saga, Event Sourcing, CQRS)
- ✅ Observability: 100% (OpenTelemetry, SigNoz, metrics)
- ⏳ Package Publishing: 0% (Next immediate task)

### Technology Stack
- Runtime: Node.js 20 LTS
- Framework: NestJS 10.4.8
- Language: TypeScript 5.7
- Database: PostgreSQL 16
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- Monitoring: SigNoz + OpenTelemetry
- Package Manager: pnpm/npm workspaces
- Build: Turborepo

### Bengali/Bangladesh Features
- ✅ Bengali number system (০১২৩৪৫৬৭৮৯)
- ✅ Currency formatting (৳ symbol)
- ✅ Friday-Saturday weekend handling
- ✅ Phone/NID/TIN validators
- ✅ VAT/AIT tax calculations
- ✅ bKash/Nagad payment tracking

## Critical Next Actions
1. Implement package publishing infrastructure
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Create Organization Service (first business service)
4. Bootstrap frontend with Next.js 15

## Notes for Context Compaction
- OpenTelemetry task 100% complete with all files created
- Package publishing task ready with clear implementation plan
- Foundation at 97% - only missing package publishing setup
- Ready for Phase 1 business services after package setup
