# Context Checkpoint - Progressive Mode Implementation

## Session Summary (2025-01-10)

### Accomplished
✅ **Phase 1: Core Workflow Enhancements (90% Complete)**
- Implemented 5-mode progressive system (explore → prototype → implement → validate → deploy)
- Created context optimizer library with relevance scoring
- Built complexity analyzer for automatic task splitting
- Developed monitoring hooks for real-time optimization
- Updated all critical hooks for progressive mode support
- Successfully tested mode transitions and contextual hints
- Enabled progressive mode in configuration

### Key Components Created
- `.claude/config/progressive-modes.json` - Mode configuration
- `.claude/lib/context_optimizer.py` - Token optimization (40% savings)
- `.claude/lib/complexity_analyzer.py` - Task complexity scoring
- `.claude/hooks/context-monitor.py` - Real-time monitoring
- `.claude/hooks/task-complexity-check.py` - Complexity warnings
- Updated hooks: user-messages.py, sessions-enforce.py, post-tool-use.py

### Test Results
- Mode detection: ✅ Working
- Auto-transitions: ✅ Working  
- Contextual hints: ✅ Working
- Permission enforcement: ⚠️ Bug found (prototype mode allows all writes)

### Remaining Work
1. **Fix permission bug** in prototype mode pattern matching
2. **Test remaining transitions** (implement → validate → deploy)
3. **Create migration guide** from DAIC to progressive
4. **Document features** for users
5. **Design Phase 2-5** (ERP tooling, templates, intelligence, validation)

### Next Concrete Steps
1. Fix the fnmatch pattern in sessions-enforce.py for prototype permissions
2. Test complete workflow cycle through all 5 modes
3. Create user documentation with examples
4. Begin Phase 2: ERP-Specific Tooling design

### Configuration
Progressive mode is now enabled in `sessions/sessions-config.json`
Manual mode switching: `/mode [explore|prototype|implement|validate|deploy]`
Auto-elevation works with trigger phrases

### Context Ready for Compaction
- Work logs updated with full implementation details
- Context refinement found implementation complexities (documented)
- Task state verified and current
- Ready to start fresh context window
