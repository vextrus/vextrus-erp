# Infrastructure Foundation Checkpoint - 80% Complete
## Date: 2025-09-22
## Task: h-complete-infrastructure-foundation
## Branch: feature/fix-remaining-services

## âœ… Accomplished in This Session

### API Gateway Fixes
- Fixed port configuration issue (auth service on 3001, not 3000)
- Corrected environment variable names (AUTH_SERVICE_URL vs AUTH_URL)
- Added SKIP_SERVICES configuration to bypass non-federation services
- API Gateway now successfully federating with auth service

### Authentication Service
- Fixed GraphQL federation with @ResolveReference decorator
- Changed from ApolloDriver to ApolloFederationDriver
- Service fully operational with federation support

### Monitoring Infrastructure
- Confirmed Prometheus already configured at port 9090
- Confirmed Grafana already configured at port 3500
- Both monitoring services running and accessible
- Credentials: admin/vextrus_grafana_2024

### Workflow Service (Partial)
- Fixed export conflicts in workflows/index.ts
- Attempted ApolloFederationDriver configuration
- Still needs completion of federation setup

## ðŸ”§ Remaining Work

### Federation Configuration Required
1. **Master Data Service** - Change to ApolloFederationDriver
2. **Workflow Service** - Complete federation configuration
3. **Rules Engine Service** - Change to ApolloFederationDriver
4. **Other Microservices** - Apply same federation pattern

### Pattern to Apply
```typescript
// Change from:
import { ApolloDriver, ApolloDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo';

// To:
import { ApolloFederationDriver, ApolloFederationDriverConfig } from '@nestjs/apollo';

// Update GraphQLModule configuration accordingly
```

## ðŸ“Š Current Infrastructure Status

### Working Services
| Service | Status | Port | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| PostgreSQL | âœ… Running | 5432 | All databases created |
| Redis | âœ… Running | 6379 | Session management ready |
| Kafka | âœ… Running | 9092 | Event streaming ready |
| API Gateway | âœ… Running | 4000 | GraphQL federation working |
| Auth Service | âœ… Running | 3001 | Federation enabled |
| Prometheus | âœ… Running | 9090 | Metrics collection active |
| Grafana | âœ… Running | 3500 | Dashboard available |
| SignOz OTEL | âœ… Running | 4317 | Telemetry collection |

### Services Needing Federation Fix
| Service | Issue | Priority |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Master Data | Needs ApolloFederationDriver | High |
| Workflow | Needs federation completion | High |
| Rules Engine | Needs ApolloFederationDriver | High |
| Other services | Same pattern needed | Medium |

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Concrete Steps

1. **Fix Master Data Service**
   ```bash
   cd services/master-data
   # Edit src/app.module.ts to use ApolloFederationDriver
   npm run build
   docker-compose restart master-data
   ```

2. **Complete Workflow Service**
   ```bash
   cd services/workflow
   # Ensure ApolloFederationDriver is properly configured
   npm run build
   docker-compose restart workflow
   ```

3. **Fix Rules Engine Service**
   ```bash
   cd services/rules-engine
   # Edit src/app.module.ts to use ApolloFederationDriver
   npm run build
   docker-compose restart rules-engine
   ```

4. **Update API Gateway SKIP_SERVICES**
   - Remove services from skip list as they're fixed
   - Test federation with each fixed service

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

1. **Federation Requirement**: All GraphQL services must use ApolloFederationDriver, not ApolloDriver
2. **Port Configuration**: Always verify service ports match docker-compose environment variables
3. **Environment Variables**: Use consistent naming (SERVICE_NAME_URL pattern)
4. **Docker Networking**: Use service names, not localhost, for inter-container communication
5. **Monitoring Stack**: Already exists and just needs to be started

## ðŸš€ Ready for Next Session

The infrastructure is 80% operational with core services running. The remaining work is straightforward - applying the same federation pattern to remaining services. The path forward is clear and well-defined.

**Access Points for Testing:**
- GraphQL Playground: http://localhost:4000/graphql
- Auth Service: http://localhost:3001
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3500 (admin/vextrus_grafana_2024)
