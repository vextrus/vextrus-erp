# Checkpoint: Infrastructure Research & Task Creation
Date: 2025-09-08
Branch: feature/productionize-package-registry
Task: h-productionize-package-registry (transitioning to h-implement-critical-infrastructure)

## What Was Accomplished

### Research Phase
- Conducted comprehensive infrastructure assessment using MCP servers
- Evaluated technology stack options for enterprise ERP
- Researched Bangladesh-specific integrations (SMS, payments)
- Analyzed budget-friendly alternatives to enterprise tools

### Task Creation
- Created 3-phase infrastructure roadmap (7 weeks total):
  - Phase 1: h-implement-critical-infrastructure (2 weeks)
  - Phase 2: h-implement-supporting-services (3 weeks)  
  - Phase 3: h-implement-production-readiness (2 weeks)

### Project Organization
- Moved 5 completed tasks to sessions/tasks/done/
- Updated work logs for h-productionize-package-registry
- Prepared infrastructure foundation for business modules

## Current State

### Technology Stack Selected
- **API Gateway**: Traefik v3.5
- **Multi-tenancy**: PostgreSQL RLS
- **File Storage**: MinIO (S3-compatible)
- **Secrets**: Docker Secrets + GitHub Secrets
- **Monitoring**: Grafana + Prometheus + Loki
- **Container**: Kubernetes with HPA

### Critical Infrastructure Gaps Identified
1. No API Gateway (blocking service routing)
2. Missing core services (Organization, Notification, File)
3. No service discovery mechanism
4. Incomplete database architecture
5. Missing security infrastructure
6. No testing strategy
7. Incomplete CI/CD
8. No monitoring/observability

## What Remains

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Switch to h-implement-critical-infrastructure task
2. Create new feature branch: feature/critical-infrastructure
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation:
   - Deploy Traefik API Gateway
   - Configure service discovery
   - Set up secrets management
   - Implement PostgreSQL multi-tenancy
   - Create Organization Service

### Blockers/Considerations
- Git branch mismatch when switching tasks (resolved by reverting)
- Budget constraints limiting tool choices
- Bangladesh localization requirements

## Next Concrete Actions

When context resumes:
1. Run task-startup protocol for h-implement-critical-infrastructure
2. Create feature/critical-infrastructure branch
3. Begin Traefik deployment with Docker Compose
4. Configure entrypoints and service discovery
5. Test routing to existing auth service

## Notes
- Infrastructure must be completed before business modules
- All technology choices prioritize budget-friendly solutions
- Bangladesh-specific integrations deferred to Phase 2
- Production readiness (Phase 3) includes full monitoring stack
