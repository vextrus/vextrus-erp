# Checkpoint: Business Architecture Foundation Implementation
Date: 2025-09-13
Task: h-implement-business-architecture-foundation
Branch: feature/business-architecture

## What Was Accomplished

### Service Configuration Fixes
‚úÖ Fixed master-data service:
- Corrected port configuration (3010 ‚Üí 3002)
- Updated database credentials (postgres ‚Üí vextrus)
- Removed problematic schema configuration
- Resolved circular dependency in DTOs

‚úÖ Fixed rules-engine service:
- Corrected port configuration (3011 ‚Üí 3012)
- Updated configuration structure

‚úÖ Fixed api-gateway service:
- Updated service URLs with correct ports
- Identified GraphQL federation issue

‚úÖ Fixed auth service:
- Service successfully running on port 3001
- Health checks passing

### Infrastructure Setup
‚úÖ Docker Compose configuration updated with correct ports
‚úÖ Database connection verified with correct credentials
‚úÖ Redis and PostgreSQL containers running

## What Remains

### Critical Issues
üî¥ **Architectural Mismatch**: Services are REST-based but API Gateway expects GraphQL
- Need to either add GraphQL to all services OR
- Switch API Gateway to REST aggregation pattern

üî¥ **Temporal Server**: Not deployed
- Workflow service cannot start without Temporal
- Requires infrastructure deployment

### Service Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è Master-data service: GraphQL schema generation failing
‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow service: Cannot connect to Temporal
‚ö†Ô∏è API Gateway: Cannot load service definitions (REST vs GraphQL)

### Database
‚ö†Ô∏è Master-data migrations not yet run
‚ö†Ô∏è Schema creation pending

## Current Blockers

1. **GraphQL vs REST Architecture Decision**
   - Most services only have REST endpoints
   - API Gateway configured for GraphQL federation
   - Requires architectural decision before proceeding

2. **Temporal Server Deployment**
   - External dependency for workflow service
   - Not included in docker-compose.yml
   - Requires separate deployment

3. **Service Dependencies**
   - Services need to be restarted with new configurations
   - Dependency order matters for startup

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Deploy Temporal server (or add to docker-compose)
2. Make architectural decision on GraphQL vs REST
3. Run database migrations for master-data
4. Restart all services with corrected configurations

### Implementation Path
1. If keeping GraphQL federation:
   - Add GraphQL schemas to auth, workflow, rules-engine
   - Update resolvers and federation directives
   
2. If switching to REST aggregation:
   - Rewrite API Gateway to use REST composition
   - Remove GraphQL federation dependencies
   - Implement API aggregation patterns

### Testing Required
- Integration tests between services
- Performance benchmarks (< 50ms MDM queries)
- Business rule validation
- End-to-end workflow testing

## Key Discoveries

1. **Service Architecture Reality**: Original plan assumed GraphQL everywhere, but implementation is REST-based
2. **Library API Differences**: json-rules-engine API differs from documentation
3. **Database Configuration**: All services need 'vextrus' user, not 'postgres'
4. **Port Allocation**: Services had inconsistent port configurations
5. **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Temporal server is external requirement

## Session Context
- Extensive debugging of service startup issues
- Fixed multiple configuration problems
- Identified fundamental architectural decisions needed
- Services partially operational but blocked on key dependencies

## Progressive Mode Status
Mode: implement
Complexity: 85 (high complexity task)
