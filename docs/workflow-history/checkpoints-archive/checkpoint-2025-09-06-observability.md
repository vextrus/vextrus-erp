# Context Checkpoint - 2025-09-06

## Current State
**Task**: h-integrate-opentelemetry-observability  
**Branch**: feature/opentelemetry-integration  
**Status**: Ready for implementation

## What Was Accomplished
✅ Completed h-package-shared-libraries task - all shared libraries properly packaged  
✅ Created comprehensive observability integration task  
✅ Enhanced task with specific NestJS patterns and code examples  
✅ Added phased implementation approach (4hr + 4hr)  
✅ Included verification steps and troubleshooting guide  

## What Remains
- [ ] Install OpenTelemetry packages in auth service
- [ ] Implement telemetry.ts initialization
- [ ] Add TelemetryModule to NestJS
- [ ] Create custom @Trace() decorator
- [ ] Test integration with SigNoz
- [ ] Add custom metrics
- [ ] Update service template

## Key Decisions
- Prioritized observability over API Gateway (unused SigNoz infrastructure)
- Using OpenTelemetry for vendor-neutral observability
- Phased approach: tracing first, then metrics
- Target <1% performance overhead

## Next Concrete Steps
1. Switch to feature/opentelemetry-integration branch
2. Install packages from task file
3. Copy telemetry.ts code and add to main.ts
4. Start services and verify traces in SigNoz
5. Add custom spans for auth operations

## Trigger Prompt for Next Session
```
Continue with the h-integrate-opentelemetry-observability task. 
Start with Phase 1: Basic Tracing implementation following the task file.
Install the OpenTelemetry packages and create the telemetry initialization.
