# Infrastructure Foundation Checkpoint
**Date:** 2025-01-20
**Task:** h-complete-infrastructure-foundation
**Branch:** feature/complete-infrastructure
**Progress:** 33% (2 of 6 subtasks completed)

## Completed Tasks

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed Docker Build Issues
- Created universal service Dockerfile (`infrastructure/docker/services/universal-service.Dockerfile`)
- Supports all services with build arguments (SERVICE_NAME, SERVICE_PORT)
- Optimized multi-stage builds with pnpm workspace support
- Added health checks for all services

### ‚úÖ 2. Added Missing Services to Docker Compose
- Successfully added 6 missing services to docker-compose.yml:
  - CRM (port 3013)
  - Finance (port 3014) - with Bangladesh-specific VAT/tax settings
  - HR (port 3015)
  - Organization (port 3016)
  - Project Management (port 3017)
  - SCM (port 3018)
- Total services configured: 37 (including infrastructure)

### ‚úÖ 3. Updated Database Initialization
- Updated PostgreSQL init.sql to create databases for all 18+ services
- Added proper schemas for each service
- Configured extensions (uuid-ossp, pgcrypto) for all databases
- Added comprehensive comments and documentation

## Current Infrastructure State

### Docker Services Configured (18 Application + 19 Infrastructure = 37 Total)
**Application Services:**
- auth, master-data, workflow, rules-engine
- notification, configuration, scheduler, document-generator
- import-export, file-storage, audit
- crm, finance, hr, organization, project-management, scm
- api-gateway

**Infrastructure Services:**
- traefik, postgres, redis, zookeeper, kafka, kafka-ui
- minio, elasticsearch, rabbitmq
- temporal, temporal-ui
- signoz-clickhouse, signoz-otel-collector, signoz-frontend, signoz-query-service
- adminer, redis-commander, verdaccio

### Port Mappings
```
3001: Auth Service
3002: Master Data
3003: Notification
3004: Configuration
3005: Scheduler
3006: Document Generator
3007: Import/Export
3008: File Storage
3009: Audit
3011: Workflow
3012: Rules Engine
3013: CRM
3014: Finance
3015: HR
3016: Organization
3017: Project Management
3018: SCM
4000: API Gateway (GraphQL)
```

## Next Steps (Remaining 67%)

### üîÑ 3. Start Core Services with Health Checks
- Start infrastructure services first
- Start core services in dependency order
- Verify health endpoints (/health, /ready, /live)
- Test inter-service communication

### ‚è≥ 4. Integrate Monitoring
- Configure Prometheus metrics collection
- Create Grafana dashboards
- Set up alerting rules
- Test OpenTelemetry tracing

### ‚è≥ 5. Set up API Documentation
- Configure Swagger for REST endpoints
- Enable GraphQL playground
- Generate Postman collections
- Document authentication flows

### ‚è≥ 6. Run Validation Testing
- Execute health check suite
- Performance baseline testing
- Security validation
- End-to-end user flow testing

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `/infrastructure/docker/services/universal-service.Dockerfile`
- `/.claude/state/checkpoint-2025-01-20-infrastructure-foundation.md`

### Modified
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Added 6 missing services
- `/infrastructure/docker/postgres/init.sql` - Updated for all services

## Validation Commands Ready
```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build --parallel

# Start infrastructure
docker-compose up -d postgres redis kafka minio temporal

# Start core services
docker-compose up -d auth master-data configuration rules-engine

# Check health
for port in 3001 3002 3003 3004 3005 3006 3007 3008 3009 3011 3012 3013 3014 3015 3016 3017 3018; do
  echo "Port $port: $(curl -s http://localhost:$port/health || echo 'Not ready')"
done
```

## Risk Areas
- Services using `node-service-simple.Dockerfile` may need updates
- Memory requirements: ~16GB RAM for all services
- Some services may not have health endpoints implemented yet
- Database migrations may be needed for new services

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 18 application services running
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] Grafana dashboards showing metrics
- [ ] API documentation accessible
- [ ] Zero critical errors in logs
- [ ] Performance within targets (<500ms API response)

## Notes
- Using Windows Docker Desktop with MinGW environment
- All services configured for development mode
- Bangladesh-specific settings added to Finance service
- OpenTelemetry configuration included for all new services
