# Checkpoint: Core Services Production Infrastructure - 50% Complete

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Task**: h-complete-core-services-production
**Branch**: feature/complete-production-infrastructure
**Progress**: 50% (3 of 6 phases complete)

## Accomplished
‚úÖ **Phase 1: Health Checks**
- Added to master-data, workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway
- Created reusable automation scripts
- All services now have /health, /health/ready, /health/live

‚úÖ **Phase 2: Prometheus Metrics**
- Added to all 5 core services (auth, master-data, workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway)
- Implemented service-specific business metrics
- All services expose /metrics endpoint

‚úÖ **Phase 3: Database Migrations**
- Generated for auth service (8 tables with RBAC)
- Generated for master-data service (6 tables with Bangladesh fields)
- Includes TIN/BIN/NID validation support

## Key Files Created
- 6 automation scripts in /scripts/
- 40+ module files across services
- 2 comprehensive migration files
- Documentation: CORE_SERVICES_PROGRESS.md, CORE_SERVICES_PRODUCTION_PLAN.md
- Next session plan: sessions/NEXT_SESSION_PLAN.md

## Remaining Work
‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Create entities & migrations for workflow/rules-engine
‚è≥ **Phase 5**: Complete Kafka integration (workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway)
‚è≥ **Phase 6**: System integration testing

## Critical Discovery
üî¥ **Organization Service** is missing ALL production components and blocks multi-tenancy. Must be addressed immediately after completing current task.

## System Status
- Infrastructure Services: 7/7 ‚úÖ Complete
- Core Services: 2/6 Complete, 3 in progress, 1 critical gap (organization)
- Business Modules: 0/5 (waiting for core completion)

## Next Session Focus
1. Complete Phase 4-6 of current task (4 hours)
2. Begin organization service production infrastructure (3 hours)
3. Document all changes and create new checkpoint

## Validation Results
‚úÖ All health modules exist and work
‚úÖ All metrics modules exist and work
‚úÖ Migrations created for auth and master-data
‚úÖ All app.module.ts files properly updated

## Blockers
None - ready to continue with Phase 4

## Notes
- Discovered automation scripts are critical infrastructure, not just convenience
- Each service needs domain-specific metrics, not generic templates
- Organization service is infrastructure dependency, not business module
