# Context Checkpoint - Task Completion
Date: 2025-09-08

## Completed Task
**Task**: h-implement-distributed-transactions-foundation
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED

## What Was Accomplished
1. **Implemented 4 Shared Libraries**:
   - @vextrus/kernel - Domain primitives and base entities
   - @vextrus/contracts - Service interfaces and DTOs  
   - @vextrus/utils - Observability and monitoring utilities
   - @vextrus/distributed-transactions - Complete transaction patterns

2. **Fixed All Tests (63/63 passing)**:
   - Resolved saga compensation issue by persisting executedSteps
   - Fixed stale saga recovery test by handling database trigger
   - No technical debt - proper architectural fixes

3. **Documentation Updated**:
   - Updated FOUNDATION_SUMMARY.md with shared libraries
   - Updated ROADMAP.md marking Phase 1 libraries complete
   - Task marked as completed with comprehensive work logs

## Key Technical Solutions
- **Saga Compensation Fix**: Modified SagaRepository to store executedSteps within saga_data JSONB as _executedSteps
- **Stale Saga Test Fix**: Temporarily disable trigger_update_saga_timestamp during test to allow manual timestamp updates

## Current State
- Task: None (cleared)
- Branch: feature/distributed-transactions-foundation (ready to merge)
- All shared libraries production-ready
- 100% test coverage with no skipped tests

## Next Steps
Ready for new task creation in fresh session. Consider:
- Organization Service implementation
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Additional microservices using the transaction patterns

## Context Ready for Clearing
All work logged, documentation updated, task completed successfully.
