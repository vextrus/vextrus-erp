# Infrastructure Foundation Checkpoint - 2025-09-21

## Task: h-complete-infrastructure-foundation

### Progress: 45% Complete

## Completed Items ✓

### 1. Docker Build Issues (100%)
- Created universal-service.Dockerfile for all NestJS services
- Added package.json files for 6 new services (CRM, Finance, HR, Organization, Project Management, SCM)
- Created basic service structure with main.ts, app.module.ts, health.controller.ts
- Fixed package name references (@vextrus/kernel instead of @vextrus/shared-kernel)
- Updated pnpm-lock.yaml to include all new services

### 2. Database Initialization (100%)
- Updated PostgreSQL init.sql with all 19 service databases
- Added proper schemas and extensions for each database
- Configured user permissions for all databases

### 3. Core Services Status (60%)
Successfully running:
- ✓ PostgreSQL (healthy)
- ✓ Redis (healthy)
- ✓ Kafka (healthy)
- ✓ Zookeeper
- ✓ Temporal
- ✓ Elasticsearch (healthy)
- ✓ Auth service (unhealthy - needs investigation)
- ✓ Audit service (healthy)
- ✓ Notification service (healthy)
- ✓ Configuration service (starting)
- ✓ Master Data service
- ✓ Rules Engine service
- ✓ SignOz OTEL Collector (replaced old collector)

Issues:
- ⚠️ Workflow service (restarting loop)
- ⚠️ Auth service (unhealthy)
- ⚠️ Docker daemon connectivity issues
- ⚠️ New services (CRM, Finance, HR, etc.) build in progress

## Current Blockers

1. **Docker Daemon Issue**: Connection errors preventing status checks
2. **Workflow Service**: Continuous restart loop needs investigation
3. **Auth Service**: Unhealthy status needs debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Restart Docker Desktop to resolve daemon issues
   - Check workflow service logs for restart cause
   - Debug auth service health check failure

2. **Then Continue**:
   - Complete startup of new services (CRM, Finance, HR, Organization, Project Management, SCM)
   - Verify all health endpoints are responding
   - Test service-to-service connectivity

3. **Remaining Subtasks**:
   - Integrate monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) - 0%
   - Set up API documentation (Swagger, GraphQL) - 0%
   - Run validation testing suite - 0%

## Files Modified

### Created
- `/infrastructure/docker/services/universal-service.Dockerfile`
- `/services/crm/package.json` and service files
- `/services/finance/package.json` and service files
- `/services/hr/package.json` and service files
- `/services/organization/package.json` and service files
- `/services/project-management/package.json` and service files
- `/services/scm/package.json` and service files

### Modified
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Added 6 new services
- `/infrastructure/docker/postgres/init.sql` - Added all service databases
- `/pnpm-lock.yaml` - Updated with new service dependencies

## Commands for Recovery

```bash
# After Docker restart:
# 1. Check service status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# 2. Check workflow service logs
docker logs vextrus-workflow --tail 50

# 3. Check auth service health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# 4. Continue starting new services
docker-compose up -d crm finance hr organization project-management scm

# 5. Verify all health endpoints
for port in 3001 3002 3003 3004 3005 3006 3007 3008 3009 3011 3012 3013 3014 3015 3016 3017 3018; do
  echo "Port $port: $(curl -s http://localhost:$port/health | head -c 50)"
done
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Service Dependencies**: New services need complete file structure before Docker build
2. **Package Names**: Workspace packages must match exactly in package.json references
3. **OTEL Collector**: Had duplicate collectors causing port conflicts (resolved)
4. **Build Time**: Full rebuild of 6+ services takes significant time

## Success Metrics Progress

- [x] All services containerized with multi-stage builds
- [x] Databases initialized with proper schemas
- [~] Health checks passing (60% complete)
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard accessible
- [ ] API documentation available
- [ ] Zero failing tests

*Next session should start by checking Docker daemon health and continuing service startup*
