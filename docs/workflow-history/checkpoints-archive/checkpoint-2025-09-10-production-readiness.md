# Checkpoint: Transition to Production Readiness
Date: 2025-09-10

## Completed Work
- ✅ h-implement-supporting-services task fully completed
- ✅ All 7 supporting services implemented and deployed
- ✅ Comprehensive testing infrastructure created:
  - Integration tests for Kafka, Bull queues, database transactions
  - E2E tests with Playwright for RBAC, file upload, notifications
  - Performance benchmarks with Artillery and K6
  - All performance targets met (RBAC < 10ms, API Gateway > 10,000 req/s)
- ✅ Enhanced API documentation with Swagger
- ✅ Task archived to sessions/tasks/done/

## Current State
- **Active Task**: h-implement-production-readiness
- **Branch**: feature/production-readiness (created and switched)
- **Services**: All services involved in production deployment
- **Focus**: Production deployment infrastructure

## What Remains
The h-implement-production-readiness task has been enhanced with:
1. **Week 1 (Days 1-4)**: Core Infrastructure
   - Set up production Docker Compose orchestration
   - Configure Traefik API Gateway with SSL/TLS
   - Implement health checks and service discovery
   - Set up SigNoz observability platform

2. **Week 1 (Days 5-7)**: Monitoring & Security
   - Configure production monitoring dashboards
   - Set up alerting rules and incident response
   - Implement security hardening and compliance
   - Configure backup and disaster recovery

3. **Week 2 (Days 8-10)**: CI/CD & Documentation
   - Create GitHub Actions production pipeline
   - Set up blue-green deployment strategy
   - Complete production runbooks
   - Final production validation

## Next Concrete Steps
1. ✅ Switched to feature/production-readiness branch
2. Set up production Docker Compose configuration
3. Configure Traefik API Gateway with production settings
4. Implement comprehensive health check system
5. Begin SigNoz observability integration

## Technical Context
- All supporting services operational and tested
- Testing infrastructure provides comprehensive coverage
- Performance benchmarks established and met
- Bangladesh-specific features fully integrated
- Multi-tenant architecture with row-level security validated

## Ready for Context Clear
All agents have completed their work:
- ✅ Logging agent updated work logs
- ✅ Context-refinement agent checked (no drift detected)
- ✅ Task state updated to new task
- ✅ Checkpoint created
- ✅ Switched to correct branch

Ready to clear context and begin production readiness implementation.
