# Checkpoint: 2025-09-09 - Ready for Supporting Services

## ‚úÖ h-implement-critical-infrastructure: COMPLETE

### What Was Accomplished
- **100% Infrastructure Complete**: All critical foundation components operational
- **Zero Technical Debt**: All issues resolved, including TypeScript imports
- **Production-Ready Foundation**: Auth, Organization, Multi-tenancy, Audit logging all working
- **Task Moved to Done**: Task file successfully archived in done/ folder

### Current State
- **Current Task**: h-implement-supporting-services
- **Branch**: feature/supporting-services
- **Services**: ["services/notification", "services/file-storage", "services/audit", "services/auth"]
- **Status**: Ready to begin implementation

## üöÄ Next Session: Supporting Services Implementation

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create Notification Service**
   - Email integration (SendGrid/SMTP)
   - SMS for Bangladesh (Alpha SMS)
   - Push notifications (Firebase)

2. **Deploy MinIO for File Storage**
   - S3-compatible object storage
   - Document management APIs

3. **Enhance Audit Service**
   - Event-driven logging
   - Compliance tracking

4. **Expand RBAC**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Tenant-aware authorization

### Services to Build
| Service | Priority | Dependencies |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Notification | HIGH | Redis, Kafka |
| File Storage | HIGH | MinIO, PostgreSQL |
| Audit | MEDIUM | PostgreSQL, Kafka |
| RBAC Enhancement | MEDIUM | Auth Service |

## üìä Project Status Overview

### Completed Tasks
- ‚úÖ h-implement-critical-infrastructure (100%)

### In Progress
- üîÑ h-implement-supporting-services (0% - Starting)

### Queued
- ‚è≥ h-implement-production-readiness
- ‚è≥ Business modules (Finance, Project Management, HR, etc.)

## üí° Key Learnings from Infrastructure Phase

1. **Environment Variables**: Services need individual configs, not connection strings
2. **TypeScript Imports**: Use `import type` for type-only imports
3. **Multi-tenancy**: RLS provides excellent isolation with minimal complexity
4. **pnpm Workspaces**: Use version numbers (^1.0.0) not workspace:* for shared packages
5. **Docker Networking**: Container names (postgres, redis) not localhost

## üéØ Success Metrics for Supporting Services

- [ ] All 4 supporting services operational
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Tenant context propagation working
- [ ] API documentation complete
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## üìù Next Session Prompt

```
Continue with h-implement-supporting-services task. 

Current status: Ready to begin implementation of supporting services that all business modules will depend on.

Priority order:
1. Notification Service (Email/SMS/Push)
2. File Storage Service with MinIO
3. Audit Service enhancement
4. RBAC expansion

Start by setting up the Notification Service with multi-channel support for Bangladesh market.
