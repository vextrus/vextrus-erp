# Infrastructure Implementation Checkpoint
**Date:** 2025-09-17
**Task:** h-implement-remaining-infrastructure
**Completion:** 70%
**Branch:** feature/remaining-infrastructure

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Completed (100%)
1. **Kubernetes Infrastructure**
   - All core service deployments (master-data, workflow, api-gateway, rules-engine, temporal)
   - All service manifests for networking
   - Horizontal pod autoscaling configurations
   - Resource limits, health probes, anti-affinity rules

2. **Health Check Framework**
   - Standardized health module in `shared/common/src/health/`
   - Comprehensive indicators (DB, Redis, Kafka, dependencies)
   - Four endpoints: `/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`, `/health/startup`

3. **Documentation**
   - `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_GAPS_ANALYSIS.md` - 3-week implementation plan
   - `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Current status

### ⚠️ Partially Complete
1. **Monitoring Stack (60%)**
   - Prometheus configuration complete
   - OpenTelemetry collector configured
   - SigNoz having compatibility issues
   - Alternative stack created (Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger)

### ❌ Remaining Work (30%)
1. **Helm Charts** - Package K8s manifests
2. **Workflow Implementation** - Business process workflows
3. **CI/CD Updates** - Pipeline for new services
4. **Performance Testing** - Load testing and baselines

## Blockers & Considerations

### Technical Issues
- **SigNoz**: OpenTelemetry collector exporter compatibility issues
- **Port Conflicts**: Resolved MinIO/ClickHouse port 9000 conflict
- **Container Dependencies**: Some services need proper initialization order

### Design Decisions
- Chose Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger over SigNoz for development
- Implemented multi-metric HPA (CPU, memory, custom metrics)
- Standardized health check patterns across all services

## Next Concrete Steps

### Immediate (Continue current task)
1. Debug and fix SigNoz monitoring stack OR commit to alternative
2. Create basic Helm chart structure with values files
3. Implement 2-3 critical workflow definitions with activities

### Short Term (Next session)
1. Update CI/CD pipelines for new services
2. Create Grafana dashboards from templates
3. Set up container registry (DockerHub/ECR/GCR)

### Medium Term (Follow-up tasks)
1. Performance testing with K6/JMeter
2. Security scanning integration
3. Disaster recovery procedures

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `infrastructure/kubernetes/deployments/*.yaml` (5 files)
- `infrastructure/kubernetes/services/*.yaml` (5 files)
- `infrastructure/kubernetes/hpa/*.yaml` (4 files)
- `shared/common/src/health/*` (3 files)
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml`
- `infrastructure/docker/signoz/otel-collector-simple.yaml`
- `infrastructure/docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml`

### Modified
- `docker-compose.yml` (port 9100 for ClickHouse)
- `infrastructure/docker/signoz/otel-collector-config.yaml`
- `sessions/tasks/h-implement-remaining-infrastructure.md` (work log)

## System State
- **Temporal**: ✅ Running (7233, 8088)
- **PostgreSQL**: ✅ Running (5432)
- **Redis**: ✅ Running (6379)
- **Kafka**: ✅ Running (9092, 9093)
- **SigNoz ClickHouse**: ✅ Running (9100)
- **SigNoz Other Components**: ❌ Failed to start
- **K8s Readiness**: ✅ All manifests ready for deployment

## Ready to Continue
The infrastructure foundation is solid. The system is ready for:
- Business logic implementation
- Workflow development
- Performance testing
- Production deployment planning

Critical blockers resolved. Infrastructure 70% complete and functional.
