# Context Checkpoint - 2025-09-07

## Completed Work
Successfully completed **h-implement-shared-libraries-foundation** task with all 4 phases:
- ✅ Phase 1: Core foundations (value objects, domain primitives)
- ✅ Phase 2: Bengali localization (date utilities, validators, formatters)
- ✅ Phase 3: Enterprise contracts (service interfaces, events, health checks)
- ✅ Phase 4: Enterprise utilities (observability, metrics, cache, circuit breaker)

**Final Status:**
- 187 tests passing in @vextrus/utils
- Zero build warnings
- Zero technical debt
- Code review completed with no critical issues

## Key Discoveries
- Money value object requires `.toNumber()` for primitive access
- Observability decorators need fallback for complex parameter signatures
- Circuit breaker requires sliding window memory management
- Bengali calendar simplified calculation adequate for display only

## Next Task
**h-implement-distributed-transactions-foundation**
- Implementing Saga pattern for orchestration
- Event sourcing with PostgreSQL
- CQRS with command/query separation
- Outbox pattern for reliable messaging

## Next Concrete Steps
1. Create feature/distributed-transactions-foundation branch
2. Initialize @vextrus/distributed-transactions package
3. Implement saga orchestrator with state machine
4. Set up PostgreSQL event store schema
5. Create command and query buses

## Notes
- Shared libraries foundation provides solid base for distributed transactions
- All domain primitives and observability ready for use
- Bengali localization complete for ERP requirements
