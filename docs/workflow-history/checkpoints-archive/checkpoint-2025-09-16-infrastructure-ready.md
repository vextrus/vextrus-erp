# Checkpoint: Infrastructure Ready for GraphQL Federation
Date: 2025-09-16
Task: h-research-infrastructure-architecture
Status: 90% Complete (Auth GraphQL nearly done, other services pending)

## What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Critical Infrastructure Fixed
- **Database Problem Solved**: Created init.sql script to initialize all 17 databases
- **Configuration Standardized**: All services now use consistent DATABASE_* variables
- **Docker Cleanup**: Archived redundant docker-compose files, kept clean structure
- **Temporal Deployed**: Workflow orchestration running and verified

### ‚úÖ GraphQL Implementation Started
- Auth service GraphQL 90% complete (minor type fixes remaining)
- All GraphQL infrastructure in place (resolvers, DTOs, guards, decorators)
- Federation directives configured for distributed schema

### ‚úÖ All Infrastructure Running
```
PostgreSQL    ‚úÖ 17 databases created
Redis         ‚úÖ Session management ready
Kafka         ‚úÖ Event streaming active
Temporal      ‚úÖ Workflow orchestration
MinIO         ‚úÖ Object storage ready
```

## What Remains

### Tomorrow Morning (High Priority)
1. **Fix Auth GraphQL** (30 min)
   - Resolve type mismatches between GraphQL and service layer
   - Test GraphQL endpoint with queries

2. **Master Data GraphQL** (2 hours)
   - Add GraphQL module and configuration
   - Create resolvers for all entities
   - Add federation support

3. **Workflow GraphQL** (2 hours)
   - Add GraphQL schemas for workflows
   - Create mutation resolvers
   - Integrate with Temporal

### Tomorrow Afternoon
4. **API Gateway Federation** (1 hour)
   - Configure gateway for GraphQL federation
   - Add service endpoints
   - Test federated queries

5. **End-to-End Testing** (1 hour)
   - Test complete authentication flow
   - Verify service communication
   - Performance benchmarking

## Key Learnings
- PostgreSQL init.sql only runs without POSTGRES_DB environment variable
- GraphQL Federation requires @key directives on entities
- Environment variable naming consistency is critical
- Docker Compose simplicity prevents configuration drift

## Next Session Entry Point

Start with:
```bash
# Quick verification
docker ps
docker exec vextrus-postgres psql -U vextrus -d postgres -c "\l" | grep vextrus

# Fix auth service GraphQL types
cd services/auth
npm run start:dev

# Test GraphQL endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ __schema { types { name } } }"}'
```

Then proceed with master-data and workflow GraphQL implementation.

## Risk Status
- Database connectivity: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- Service configuration: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- GraphQL complexity: ‚ö†Ô∏è MANAGEABLE (step-by-step approach working)
- API Gateway: üî¥ BLOCKED (waiting on service GraphQL)

## Files to Reference Next Session
- `services/auth/src/resolvers/auth.resolver.ts` - Type fixes needed
- `services/master-data/` - Add GraphQL similar to auth
- `services/workflow/` - Add GraphQL with Temporal integration
- `apps/api-gateway/` - Configure federation after services ready

---
Infrastructure foundation is solid. Ready for rapid GraphQL implementation across remaining services.
