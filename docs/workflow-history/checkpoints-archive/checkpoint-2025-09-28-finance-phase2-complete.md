## What Remains To Be Done

### Phase 3: GraphQL Resolvers Implementation
1. Create resolver files for all GraphQL operations
2. Connect resolvers to application services
3. Implement data loaders for performance
4. Add authentication/authorization middleware

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing
1. Bangladesh-specific validation middleware
2. Unit tests for domain entities
3. Integration tests for services
4. E2E tests for GraphQL operations

### Phase 5: Payment Gateway Integration
1. SSLCommerz integration
2. bKash API integration
3. Nagad API integration
4. Bank API integrations

## Current State Summary
- **Infrastructure**: 100% operational
- **Finance Module Business Logic**: 85% complete
- **GraphQL Schema**: 100% defined
- **GraphQL Resolvers**: 0% implemented
- **Testing**: 0% implemented
- **Payment Gateways**: 0% integrated

## Next Concrete Steps
1. Create GraphQL resolver structure
2. Implement Query resolvers for invoices and payments
3. Implement Mutation resolvers for CRUD operations
4. Add validation middleware for Bangladesh rules
5. Create integration tests

## Environment Status
- All TypeORM entities created and ready
- GraphQL schema fully defined
- Application services implemented with business logic
- Event store configured for audit trails
- Database migrations pending creation

## Notes for Next Session
- Focus on GraphQL resolver implementation
- Ensure all services are properly injected
- Add proper error handling in resolvers
- Implement data loaders to avoid N+1 queries
- Consider adding caching for reports
