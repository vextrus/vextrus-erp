# Infrastructure Rebuild Checkpoint - 2025-09-26

## Current Status
- Task: h-fix-infrastructure-achieve-100-percent-readiness
- Progress: 40% (Services partially fixed)
- Mode: implement
- Phase: emergency-recovery

## What Was Accomplished

### Fixed Services
1. **Organization Service** ✅
   - Added missing dependencies (@nestjs/terminus, kafkajs, prom-client)
   - Fixed DATABASE_USERNAME configuration
   - Health endpoints working at /health
   - Successfully rebuilt and deployed

2. **Workflow Service** ✅
   - Modified main.ts to exclude health endpoints from API prefix
   - Added missing dependencies (typeorm, @nestjs/terminus, kafkajs, pg, prom-client)
   - Successfully built after dependency fixes
   - Health endpoints now accessible at correct paths

### Infrastructure Fixes
1. **Docker Configuration** ✅
   - daemon.json configured with insecure-registries and mirror
   - Using mirror.gcr.io for faster pulls
   - Certificate issues resolved

2. **Build Helper Script** ✅
   - Created .claude/libs/build-helper.py for long-running builds
   - Handles Windows encoding issues
   - Provides background build monitoring

## Current Issues

### Context Management Problems
- Background bash processes generating excessive output
- Not following established .claude/ workflow patterns
- Context filling up too quickly with verbose logs

### Services Still Broken
1. **Rules Engine** - Build/health issues
2. **Import-Export** - Not running
3. **File Storage** - Not running
4. **Configuration** - Port not exposed
5. **Scheduler** - Port not exposed
6. **Notification** - Port not exposed
7. **Audit** - Port not exposed
8. **Document Generator** - Port not exposed

## Next Concrete Steps

1. **Fix Context Management**
   - Kill any background processes
   - Use output filtering for verbose commands
   - Follow established protocols

2. **Continue Service Fixes**
   - Rules Engine: Fix build and health endpoints
   - Import-Export: Fix startup issues
   - File Storage: Fix startup issues
   - Other services: Expose ports and fix health

3. **Create Final Report**
   - Document all fixes
   - Verify all health endpoints
   - Test complete infrastructure

## Key Learnings

1. **Always manage background processes** - Kill or filter verbose output
2. **Follow established workflows** - Use .claude/ and sessions/ protocols
3. **Use progressive modes properly** - Don't stay in implement mode unnecessarily
4. **Filter tool output** - Use head/tail/grep for large outputs
