# Checkpoint: Distributed Transactions Foundation
Date: 2025-09-07
Task: h-implement-distributed-transactions-foundation
Branch: feature/distributed-transactions-foundation

## Accomplished
✅ **Core Infrastructure** (Phase 1 Complete)
- Implemented event sourcing with PostgreSQL backend
- Built saga orchestrator with state machine
- Created outbox pattern for reliable messaging
- Added idempotency middleware (24-hour TTL)
- Integrated with @vextrus/kernel value objects

✅ **Database Setup**
- Created and ran PostgreSQL migrations
- Established event_store, saga_state, outbox_events, idempotency_keys tables
- Added indexes and triggers for performance

✅ **Example Implementation**
- Complete Order-to-Cash workflow with compensation handlers
- OrderAggregate with full event sourcing
- OrderFulfillmentSaga demonstrating multi-step transactions

✅ **Testing Foundation**
- 57 unit tests written (40 failing due to implementation gaps)
- Test coverage for aggregates, event store, saga, idempotency

## Remaining Work
1. **Fix Test Failures** (17/57 passing)
   - Missing methods in aggregate base (loadFromSnapshot, validateState)
   - Event store service needs error handling fixes
   - Idempotency service missing store/complete/fail methods

2. **CQRS Implementation**
   - Command bus with handler registration
   - Query bus for read model access
   - Event bus for domain event publishing

3. **Projection Builders**
   - Read model projections from event streams
   - Snapshot optimization for long streams

4. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end saga execution tests
   - Compensation rollback scenarios
   - Outbox reliability tests

5. **Performance & Documentation**
   - Benchmark event store operations
   - Load test saga orchestration
   - Complete API documentation

## Next Concrete Steps
1. Fix the 40 failing unit tests by completing missing method implementations
2. Add CQRS command and query buses using NestJS CQRS module
3. Create integration test suite with PostgreSQL test containers
4. Implement projection builders for read model generation
5. Run performance benchmarks and create documentation

## Technical Considerations
- Build order dependency: kernel → utils → contracts → transactions
- Package.json exports must use .js not .mjs for TypeScript compatibility
- Tests require all dependent packages to be built first
- PostgreSQL must be running for integration tests

## Blockers
None - all dependencies resolved, database operational, core structure in place

The distributed transactions foundation is structurally complete but needs implementation refinement and testing completion before production use.
