# Context Checkpoint - Supporting Services Implementation
**Date:** 2025-09-09
**Task:** h-implement-supporting-services
**Branch:** feature/supporting-services

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Fully Implemented Services

1. **Import/Export Service (Port 3007)**
   - Complete implementation with entities, DTOs, controllers, services
   - Async job processing with Bull queues
   - Data mapping and transformation system
   - Support for CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, TSV formats
   - Bangladesh-specific validators (phone, TIN)
   - Batch processing with progress tracking

2. **File Storage Service (Port 3008)**
   - MinIO S3-compatible object storage integration
   - Multi-tenant file isolation with bucket strategies
   - Storage policies with retention/lifecycle rules
   - Thumbnail generation for images
   - File versioning and presigned URLs
   - Folder management system

3. **Audit Service (Port 3009)**
   - Elasticsearch-based audit logging
   - Comprehensive compliance reporting:
     - SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA
     - Bangladesh Digital Security Act
     - Bangladesh ICT Act
   - Real-time event ingestion via Kafka
   - Retention policies with automated cleanup
   - Anomaly detection for security events
   - Multiple controllers for different aspects

### ⚠️ Basic Structure Only
- Scheduler Service (Port 3005) - Package.json only
- Document Generator Service (Port 3006) - Package.json only

## What Remains to Be Done

1. **Complete Scheduler Service Implementation**
   - Cron job management
   - Task queuing with Bull
   - Job history tracking

2. **Complete Document Generator Service**
   - Template management
   - PDF/Excel generation
   - Report scheduling

3. **Integration Tasks**
   - Integration testing across all services
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Load testing

4. **Documentation**
   - API documentation updates
   - Service integration guides

## Next Concrete Steps

After context restart, the user should:

1. **Verify All Implemented Services:**
   ```bash
   # Start each service and check health endpoints
   cd services/import-export && npm install && npm run dev
   cd services/file-storage && npm install && npm run dev  
   cd services/audit && npm install && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Health Endpoints:**
   - http://localhost:3007/health (Import/Export)
   - http://localhost:3008/health (File Storage)
   - http://localhost:3009/health (Audit)

3. **Verify External Dependencies:**
   - MinIO for File Storage Service
   - Elasticsearch for Audit Service
   - PostgreSQL for all services
   - Kafka for event streaming
   - Redis for Bull queues

4. **Continue With:**
   - Complete Scheduler Service implementation
   - Complete Document Generator Service implementation
   - Run integration tests

## Technical Notes

- All services follow NestJS architecture patterns
- Multi-tenant support implemented consistently
- Kafka integration for event-driven communication
- Health checks and observability endpoints included
- Bangladesh-specific business logic integrated

## Blockers/Considerations

None identified. All implemented services are ready for integration testing.
