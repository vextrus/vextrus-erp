# Context Checkpoint: Supporting Services Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Task**: h-implement-supporting-services  
**Branch**: feature/supporting-services  
**Context Usage**: 90.3% (144,533/160,000 tokens)

## What Was Accomplished

### Services Deployed and Operational
1. **Notification Service (port 3003)** ✅
   - Fixed all TypeScript errors
   - Built Docker image successfully
   - Database: vextrus_notification created
   - Health endpoint verified: {"status":"ok"}
   
2. **Audit Service (port 3009)** ✅
   - Fixed 109 TypeScript errors via sub-agent
   - Elasticsearch integration working
   - Database: vextrus_audit created
   - Health endpoint verified: {"status":"ok"}
   
3. **Document Generator Service (port 3006)** ✅
   - Fixed 11 TypeScript errors (PaperSize, imports, etc.)
   - PDF/Excel/Word generation fully implemented
   - Database: vextrus_document_generator created
   - Health endpoint verified: {"status":"ok"}

### Technical Issues Resolved
- Fixed DATABASE_USER vs DATABASE_USERNAME environment variable mismatch
- Resolved TypeORM enum issues with enumName properties
- Fixed missing dependencies (pizzip, docxtemplater)
- Resolved Docker build timeouts for puppeteer Chrome downloads
- Changed to NODE_ENV=production to avoid TypeORM sync issues

## What Remains To Be Done

### From h-implement-supporting-services task:
1. **Complete Scheduler Service** (port 3005)
   - Currently only basic structure exists
   - Need cron job management implementation
   
2. **Expand User/Role management with RBAC**
   - Integrate with existing auth service
   - Implement role-based access control
   
3. **Set up service integration testing**
   - Create test suite for inter-service communication
   - Verify tenant isolation across services
   
4. **Implement end-to-end testing suite**
   - Full workflow testing across all services
   - Performance benchmarking
   
5. **Document service APIs and usage**
   - OpenAPI specifications
   - Integration guides

## Key Technical Learnings
- TypeScript compilation in Docker requires stricter type checking
- Use ES6 default imports for certain packages in containerized builds
- Docker layer caching critical for large dependencies (puppeteer)
- Environment variable naming must be consistent across docker-compose and app modules

## Next Concrete Steps
1. Complete Scheduler Service implementation with Bull queue management
2. Design and implement RBAC system expansion
3. Create integration test suite using Jest/Supertest
4. Document all service APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI

## Continuation Prompt
"Continue the h-implement-supporting-services task. Three services (Notification, Audit, Document-Generator) are deployed and healthy. Focus on: 1) Completing Scheduler Service, 2) Implementing RBAC expansion, 3) Creating integration tests, 4) Performance benchmarking, and 5) API documentation. All databases are created and services are running on their designated ports."
