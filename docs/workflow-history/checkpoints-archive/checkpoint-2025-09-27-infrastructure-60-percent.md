# Infrastructure Checkpoint - 60% Operational
Date: 2025-09-27
Task: h-fix-infrastructure-achieve-100-percent-readiness
Progress: 40% → 60%

## What Was Accomplished

### TypeScript Compilation Fixes
- **Rules Engine Service**: Fixed duplicate imports and migration syntax errors
- **Import-Export Service**: Fixed namespace imports and type annotations
- **File Storage Service**: Resolved 24 compilation errors across multiple files
- All three services now compile successfully locally with `pnpm build`

### Health Endpoint Verification
Confirmed working health endpoints for 5 additional services:
- Notification (3003): `/api/health` ✓
- Configuration (3004): `/api/health` ✓
- Scheduler (3005): `/api/health` ✓
- Document Generator (3006): `/api/health` ✓
- Audit (3009): `/api/health` ✓

## Current Infrastructure Status

### Running Services (11/13)
- ✅ Auth, Master-data, Organization, Workflow
- ✅ Notification, Configuration, Scheduler, Document-generator, Audit
- ⚠️ Rules-engine (running but missing dependencies)
- ✅ API Gateway

### Failed Services (2/13)
- ❌ Import-Export: Docker container missing @nestjs/core and other dependencies
- ❌ File-Storage: Docker container missing @nestjs/schedule

## What Remains To Be Done

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1 Completion)
1. **Fix Docker Dependency Issues**
   - Import-Export and File-Storage services fail in containers
   - Dependencies installed locally but not in Docker builds
   - Need to investigate Dockerfile and pnpm workspace configuration

2. **Add Missing Health Endpoints**
   - Workflow service needs health endpoint implementation
   - Rules Engine service needs health endpoint implementation

3. **Configuration Service GraphQL**
   - Re-enable GraphQL module (currently commented out)
   - Fix module dependency conflicts

### Next Phases
- Phase 2: Security Hardening (HTTPS, secrets management, rate limiting)
- Phase 3: Complete Service TODOs
- Phase 4: Kubernetes manifests
- Phase 5: Integration testing

## Blockers and Considerations

### Critical Blocker: Docker Build Process
- Services compile locally but fail in Docker
- Suggests issue with multi-stage builds or pnpm workspace handling
- May need to rebuild base images or adjust Dockerfile strategy

### Technical Debt
- PrometheusModule commented out in Import-Export to avoid errors
- Some services using stub implementations
- TypeScript strict mode causing numerous type issues

## Next Concrete Steps

1. **Investigate Docker Build Issues**
   ```bash
   docker exec vextrus-import-export ls -la node_modules/@nestjs/
   docker exec vextrus-file-storage ls -la node_modules/@nestjs/
   ```

2. **Fix Dockerfile Dependency Installation**
   - Review universal-service.Dockerfile
   - Ensure pnpm install includes all workspace dependencies
   - Consider using --shamefully-hoist flag

3. **Test Fixed Containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build import-export file-storage
   docker logs vextrus-import-export --tail 50
   docker logs vextrus-file-storage --tail 50
   ```

4. **Verify All Services Health**
   ```bash
   python test-health-endpoints.py
   ```

## Key Discoveries This Session

1. **Health Endpoint Inconsistency**: Services use different paths (/health, /api/health, /api/v1/health)
2. **Docker vs Local Discrepancy**: TypeScript compilation succeeds locally but containers missing runtime dependencies
3. **Testing Script Issues**: Health endpoint test script had false positives for "port_not_exposed"
