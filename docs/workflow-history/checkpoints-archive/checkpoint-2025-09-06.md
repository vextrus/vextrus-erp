# Context Checkpoint - 2025-09-06

## Task Completed: h-optimize-development-foundation

### Accomplished
- ✅ Complete analysis of entire codebase structure and documentation
- ✅ Research and integrate latest best practices using Context7 MCP server
- ✅ Optimize infrastructure configuration (Docker, TypeScript, testing)
- ✅ Enhance service layer architecture with CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns
- ✅ Establish clear development patterns and conventions
- ✅ Create shared domain primitives and contracts
- ✅ Create service template generator for rapid service creation
- ✅ Store comprehensive knowledge in MCP memory server (8 entities)
- ✅ Validate all configurations and dependencies

### Current State
- All Docker services running healthy (PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, SigNoz)
- TypeScript configuration optimized with strict mode
- Authentication service enhanced with enterprise patterns
- Shared domain primitives created in shared/kernel/domain
- Service contracts established in shared/contracts
- Service template generator ready at services/service-template/generate-service.js

### Known Issues (Documented in MCP Memory)
- 133 build errors in auth service requiring resolution:
  - Entity property mismatches (passwordHash vs password)
  - Missing properties (isLocked, roleId, isActive)
  - TypeORM entity registration issues
  - Configuration type safety problems

### Next Concrete Steps
1. Fix User entity to align with domain model
2. Add missing properties and relations to entities
3. Fix ConfigService type safety issues
4. Register all TypeORM entities properly
5. Ensure build completes without errors

### Context Ready for Clearing
- Task completed and documented
- Knowledge preserved in MCP memory
- Build issues identified for next session
- Work logs updated
