# Checkpoint: GraphQL Implementation Complete
Date: 2025-09-17
Task: Infrastructure Research and GraphQL Implementation

## What Was Accomplished

### GraphQL Service Implementation (100% Complete)
1. **Master Data Service GraphQL**:
   - Fixed JWT authentication to handle GraphQL execution context
   - Fixed CurrentTenant decorator for GraphQL context extraction
   - Resolved GraphQL schema conflicts with @HideField decorator
   - Created all required database tables (products, customers, vendors, chart_of_accounts)
   - Fixed comprehensive field mapping between GraphQL DTOs and database columns
   - Successfully tested queries and mutations with authentication
   - Service running successfully on port 3002

2. **Technical Solutions Implemented**:
   - GraphQL context extraction pattern for authentication guards
   - Multi-tenant support via x-tenant-id headers
   - Field transformation in resolvers for DTO to entity mapping
   - REST and GraphQL endpoints coexistence in same service

3. **Validation Complete**:
   - GraphQL queries return paginated results
   - Mutations create and persist data correctly
   - Authentication and authorization working
   - Multi-tenant data isolation functioning

## What Remains To Be Done

### Infrastructure Components (New Task Required)
1. **Temporal Workflow Engine**:
   - Deploy Temporal server locally
   - Create workflow definitions
   - Implement activity workers
   - Test long-running processes

2. **Production Deployment Strategy**:
   - Kubernetes manifest creation
   - Helm charts for services
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Environment-specific configs

3. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboard setup
   - Distributed tracing configuration

4. **Infrastructure as Code**:
   - Terraform modules for cloud resources
   - Docker Compose for local development
   - Service mesh configuration
   - Secret management setup

## Current Service Status
- **Master Data Service**: ✅ Running (port 3002, GraphQL fully functional)
- **Auth Service**: ✅ Running (port 3000)
- **API Gateway**: ✅ Running (port 4000)
- **Database**: ✅ Running (PostgreSQL on 5432)
- **Cache**: ✅ Running (Redis on 6379)

## Next Concrete Steps
1. Create new task for remaining infrastructure implementation
2. Focus on Temporal workflow engine deployment
3. Set up production deployment strategies
4. Implement comprehensive monitoring

## Notes
- GraphQL implementation discovered some TypeORM synchronization issues requiring manual table creation
- Field mapping patterns established for GraphQL DTO to database entity transformation
- Multi-tenant GraphQL pattern validated and working
- Ready for production GraphQL traffic after remaining infrastructure is complete
