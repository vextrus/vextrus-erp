## Issues for Next Session Investigation

Based on current state, here are potential areas to investigate:

### 1. Backend Services Status
**Current task**: `h-implement-finance-backend-business-logic`
**Branch**: `feature/implement-finance-backend-business-logic`

**Investigate**:
- What's the actual completion status of finance backend?
- Are there any GraphQL federation issues?
- Are backend services running properly?
- Any blocking issues preventing progress?

### 2. Workflow System Integration
**Status**: Workflow engine built but not fully tested in production

**Investigate**:
- Test real Task tool integration with agents
- Validate cache persistence works correctly
- Confirm orchestration patterns work with real agents
- Test fallback mechanisms

### 3. Hook Performance
**Status**: 4 hooks redesigned, but need validation

**Investigate**:
- Are hooks causing any delays?
- Do they work correctly with CC 2.0.17?
- Any edge cases breaking the read-only pattern?

### 4. MCP Server Configuration
**Current**: 6 enabled by default, 11 disabled

**Investigate**:
- Are the right MCP servers enabled for Bangladesh ERP work?
- Should we enable github, playwright, or serena for production?
- Any conflicts between MCP servers?

### 5. Context Management
**Current**: 93% context usage (CRITICAL)

**Investigate**:
- Is context optimizer working correctly?
- Should we adjust context retention policies?
- Are there memory leaks in long sessions?

## Next Session Quick Start

### Files to Read First
1. `.claude/state/CHECKPOINT_2025-10-16_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md` (this file)
2. `.claude/CORRECTED_WORKFLOW_STATUS_AND_PLAN.md`
3. `CLAUDE.md` (v2.0 reference)
4. `.claude/state/current_task.json` (current work)

### Commands to Run
```bash
# Check current state
cat .claude/state/current_task.json
git status
git branch --show-current

# Verify cleanup worked
du -sh .claude/
du -sh .claude/state/

# Check workflow system
python .claude/libs/workflow-engine.py list-workflows
python .claude/libs/agent-cache.py status
```

### Investigation Priority
1. **Backend services status** - What's blocking finance backend?
2. **Workflow integration** - Does it work with real agents?
3. **Production readiness** - Any critical blockers?
