# Infrastructure Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-09-17
## Status: 70% Complete

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Kubernetes Manifests (100%)
- **Created Deployments for Core Services:**
  - `master-data-deployment.yaml` - 2 replicas, health checks, resource limits
  - `workflow-deployment.yaml` - 2 replicas, Temporal integration
  - `api-gateway-deployment.yaml` - 3 replicas, Apollo Federation
  - `rules-engine-deployment.yaml` - 2 replicas, business logic
  - `temporal-deployment.yaml` - Temporal server and UI

- **Created Service Manifests:**
  - All deployments have corresponding ClusterIP services
  - Proper port mappings for HTTP and metrics
  - Prometheus annotations for scraping

### 2. Health Checks Implementation (100%)
- **Standardized Health Module Created:**
  - `shared/common/src/health/health.controller.ts` - REST endpoints
  - `shared/common/src/health/health.indicators.ts` - Health checks for:
    - Database connectivity
    - Redis connectivity
    - Kafka connectivity
    - Service dependencies
    - Memory usage
    - Migration status
    - Temporal connectivity
  - `shared/common/src/health/health.module.ts` - NestJS module

- **Health Endpoints:**
  - `/health` - Overall health status
  - `/health/ready` - Readiness check
  - `/health/live` - Liveness check
  - `/health/startup` - Startup check

### 3. Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (100%)
- **Created HPA Configurations:**
  - `master-data-hpa.yaml` - 2-10 replicas, CPU/Memory based
  - `api-gateway-hpa.yaml` - 3-20 replicas, includes request rate metric
  - `workflow-hpa.yaml` - 2-10 replicas, includes queue size metric
  - `rules-engine-hpa.yaml` - 2-8 replicas, CPU/Memory based

- **Scaling Policies:**
  - Conservative scale-down (5 minute stabilization)
  - Aggressive scale-up (30-60 second response)
  - Percentage and pod-based scaling limits

### 4. Temporal Workflow Engine (100%)
- **Running Components:**
  - Temporal server on port 7233
  - Temporal UI on port 8088
  - PostgreSQL backend configured
  - Dynamic configuration for vextrus namespace

### 5. Monitoring Configuration (80%)
- **Prometheus Configuration:**
  - `prometheus.yml` created with scrape configs for all services
  - Job definitions for Node.js services, Kafka, Redis, Temporal
  - External labels for environment tracking

- **OpenTelemetry Collector:**
  - Simple configuration created
  - OTLP receivers configured (gRPC: 4317, HTTP: 4318)
  - Prometheus exporter configured

- **Alternative Stack Created:**
  - `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` with Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger
  - Simplified setup for development environment

## ⚠️ Partially Complete

### 1. Monitoring Stack Deployment (60%)
- SigNoz ClickHouse running but other components failing
- Created alternative monitoring stack configuration
- Need to debug container startup issues

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (20%)
- Existing GitHub Actions workflows present
- Need to update for new services
- Container registry management pending

## ❌ Not Started

### 1. Helm Charts
- Need to package all K8s manifests
- Environment-specific values files
- Dependency management

### 2. Workflow Implementation
- Additional workflow definitions needed
- Activity workers implementation
- Error handling and recovery patterns

### 3. Performance Testing
- Load testing scripts
- Capacity planning
- Baseline establishment

### 4. Security Scanning
- Container vulnerability scanning
- Secrets management solution
- Network policies implementation

## Critical Path Forward

### Immediate (P0)
1. Debug and fix monitoring stack deployment
2. Create initial Helm chart structure
3. Implement 2-3 critical workflows

### Short Term (P1)
1. Complete CI/CD pipeline updates
2. Set up container registry
3. Create Grafana dashboards
4. Implement alerting rules

### Medium Term (P2)
1. Performance testing and optimization
2. Security scanning integration
3. Disaster recovery procedures
4. Documentation updates

## Technical Debt

1. **Monitoring Stack:** SigNoz integration issues need resolution
2. **Configuration Management:** Need centralized config management
3. **Secrets Management:** Currently using K8s secrets, need Vault
4. **Service Mesh:** Consider Istio for advanced traffic management

## Resource Requirements

### Development
- Docker Desktop: Currently using ~6GB RAM
- Kubernetes: Ready for local deployment (minikube/k3s)

### Production
- Minimum 3 node cluster (8 vCPU, 16GB RAM each)
- Managed services recommended for:
  - PostgreSQL (RDS/CloudSQL)
  - Redis (ElastiCache/Memorystore)
  - Container Registry (ECR/GCR/ACR)

## Success Metrics Status

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| API Response Time | < 300ms | Not measured | ⏳ |
| Service Availability | > 99.9% | Not measured | ⏳ |
| Deployment Frequency | Daily | Manual | ❌ |
| MTTR | < 30 min | Not measured | ⏳ |
| Health Check Coverage | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| K8s Manifest Coverage | 100% | 100% | ✅ |

## Next Actions

1. **Today:**
   - Debug monitoring stack issues
   - Start Helm chart creation
   - Test health endpoints manually

2. **Tomorrow:**
   - Implement first workflow with activities
   - Create basic Grafana dashboard
   - Update CI/CD pipeline

3. **This Week:**
   - Complete all Helm charts
   - Run first load test
   - Document deployment procedures

## Notes

- Infrastructure foundation is solid with K8s manifests complete
- Health checks provide good observability foundation
- HPA ensures scalability under load
- Monitoring needs attention but alternatives available
- Ready to proceed with business logic implementation
