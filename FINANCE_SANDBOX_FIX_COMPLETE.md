# Finance Apollo Sandbox Fix - COMPLETE âœ…

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Issue**: Finance service serving GraphQL Playground instead of Apollo Sandbox
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED

## Root Cause
Finance service configured with development volume mounts, causing module resolution conflicts that prevented @apollo/server plugin from loading.

## Solution Applied
Removed volume mounts from docker-compose.yml. Finance now runs from Docker build like other services.

## Verification
âœ… Service healthy and running
âœ… Logs show "ðŸ”¥ Apollo Sandbox: http://localhost:3014/graphql"
âœ… GraphQL route mapped correctly
âœ… No module resolution errors

## Files Modified
- `docker-compose.yml`: Removed finance volume mounts (lines 934-943)
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`: Updated for shared/graphql-schema package
