## Architecture Philosophy

**v3.0 Approach**: **Agent-First + Optimized Skills**

### Evolution
- **v1.0** (Skills-First): 17 skills, 8,683 lines, 5% activation rate → FAILED
- **v2.0** (Agent-Only): 0 skills, too extreme → User feedback
- **v3.0** (Hybrid): 4 skills, ~1,030 lines, 70%+ activation target → OPTIMIZED ✅

### Design Principles
1. **Agent-First**: 33 agents are primary (explicit invocation)
2. **Focused Skills**: 4 domain-specific skills for instant patterns
3. **88% Size Reduction**: From 8,683 lines → 1,030 lines
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Load on trigger words only
5. **Context Optimized**: <0.2% overhead vs 3.5% in v1.0

**Primary Workflow**: Use agents (see `.claude/agents/AGENT-DIRECTORY.md`), skills provide supplementary domain expertise.

## Skills Directory

### 1. haiku-explorer
**File**: `haiku-explorer/SKILL.md` (200 lines, 68% reduction from v1.0)
**Triggers**: "where", "find", "explore", "locate"

**Purpose**: Fast Haiku 4.5 codebase exploration before implementation

**When to Use**:
- Unfamiliar codebase area
- Need to find files (>3 files)
- Multi-service tasks
- "Where is X?" questions

**Thoroughness Levels**:
```bash
# Quick (30-60 sec)
/explore services/finance

# Medium (1-2 min)
/explore services/finance/src/domain

# Very Thorough (2-3 min)
/explore services/finance --thorough
```

**Success Metrics**:
- 95% success rate
- 86% context savings (10-20 files → 3-5 files)
- 23 min time savings per task average

**See**: `.claude/skills/haiku-explorer/SKILL.md`

---

### 2. vextrus-domain-expert
**File**: `vextrus-domain-expert/SKILL.md` (260 lines, NEW in v3.0)
**Triggers**: "Bangladesh", "VAT", "TDS", "construction", "real estate", "property", "lease"

**Purpose**: Bangladesh Construction & Real Estate ERP domain expertise

**Coverage**:
1. **Bangladesh Compliance** (NBR)
   - VAT: 15% standard, 5% reduced, 0% exempt/export
   - TDS/AIT: 5% (with TIN), 7.5% (without TIN), 10% (professionals)
   - Mushak 6.3: Auto-generation with QR code
   - Fiscal Year: July-June (NOT calendar year)

2. **Construction Management**
   - Progress billing (% completion)
   - Retention: 10% standard
   - RAJUK approval integration
   - Budget tracking (allocated, spent, committed, available)

3. **Real Estate Management**
   - Property lifecycle (acquire → develop → list → sell/lease)
   - Lease management (monthly rent, security deposit, auto-invoicing)
   - Sales pipeline (lead → viewing → negotiation → closed)
   - Required documents (deed, RAJUK, tax certificates)

**Example Triggers**:
```typescript
"Calculate Bangladesh VAT for construction materials"  → Activates skill
"Create progress billing invoice with 10% retention"  → Activates skill
"Generate Mushak 6.3 for invoice approval"            → Activates skill
"Property lease with security deposit"                → Activates skill
```

**See**: `.claude/skills/vextrus-domain-expert/SKILL.md`

---

### 3. production-ready-workflow
**File**: `production-ready-workflow/SKILL.md` (305 lines, NEW in v3.0)
**Triggers**: "production", "checkpoint", "quality gates", "deploy"

**Purpose**: Checkpoint-driven development + quality gates + production deployment

**Coverage**:
1. **Checkpoint-Driven Development**
   - When: After 4-8 hour phases, end of day, before context switch
   - Template: 300-600 lines (summary, files, quality gates, learnings)
   - Proven: 9.5/10 quality, <5% rework, 0 bugs in finance task

2. **Quality Gates** (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
   ```bash
   pnpm build     # Zero TypeScript errors
   npm test       # All tests passing
   ```

   **Agent Reviews** (Medium+ tasks):
   - `kieran-typescript-reviewer` (MANDATORY)
   - `security-sentinel` (if auth/RBAC/sensitive data)
   - `performance-oracle` (if caching/optimization)

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Pre-deployment: Security, performance, data integrity reviews
   - Strategy: Phased rollout (5% → 50% → 100%) or blue-green
   - Post-deployment: Health checks, metrics, logs, rollback plan

4. **Commit Message Format**
   - Simple: 3-5 lines with Co-Authored-By
   - Checkpoint: Comprehensive (features, quality gates, reviews, checkpoint link)

**Example Triggers**:
```
"Create checkpoint after Phase 2 completion"  → Activates skill
"Prepare for production deployment"           → Activates skill
"Review code quality with all gates"          → Activates skill
```

**Proven Metrics** (Finance Task):
- Time: 10 days
- Quality: 9.5/10
- Bugs: 0
- Rework: <5%
- Pattern consistency: 100%

**See**: `.claude/skills/production-ready-workflow/SKILL.md`

### 4. graphql-event-sourcing
**File**: `graphql-event-sourcing/SKILL.md` (265 lines, NEW in v3.0)
**Triggers**: "GraphQL", "federation", "event sourcing", "CQRS", "aggregate", "@key"

**Purpose**: Core Vextrus architecture - GraphQL Federation v2 + Event Sourcing + CQRS

**Coverage**:
1. **GraphQL Federation v2**
   ```graphql
   # Entity with @key directive
   type Invoice @key(fields: "id") {
     id: ID!
     customer: Customer  # Cross-service reference
   }

   # Pagination (ALWAYS for lists)
   invoices(page: Int, limit: Int): InvoicePage!

   # Mutation with payload type
   createInvoice(input: CreateInvoiceInput!): InvoicePayload!
   ```

2. **Event Sourcing**
   ```typescript
   // Events: Immutable, past tense, versioned
   export class InvoiceCreatedEvent implements DomainEvent {
     readonly eventType = 'InvoiceCreated';
     readonly version = 1;
     readonly occurredOn: Date;
   }

   // Aggregates: Small, focused, enforce invariants
   export class Invoice extends AggregateRoot {
     static create(...) { /* Factory */ }
     approve(...) { /* Business logic */ }
     private onInvoiceCreatedEvent(...) { /* Event handler */ }
   }
   ```

3. **CQRS**
   ```typescript
   // Command Handler (Write Side)
   @CommandHandler(CreateInvoiceCommand)
   async execute(command) { /* Save to event store */ }

   // Query Handler (Read Side)
   @QueryHandler(GetInvoiceQuery)
   async execute(query) { /* Read from projection */ }

   // Projection Handler (Event → Read Model)
   @EventsHandler(InvoiceCreatedEvent)
   async handle(event) { /* Update read model, invalidate cache */ }
   ```

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Use `@key` on ALL federated entities
- ✅ ALWAYS paginate list queries
- ✅ Events are immutable (past tense)
- ✅ Aggregates are small (1 root entity)
- ✅ Cache invalidation in projection handlers

**Example Triggers**:
```
"Create Invoice aggregate with federation"     → Activates skill
"Implement CQRS command and query handlers"    → Activates skill
"Add GraphQL mutation with payload type"       → Activates skill
```

**See**: `.claude/skills/graphql-event-sourcing/SKILL.md`

## Skill Activation

### How Skills Load

**Progressive Disclosure**:
1. Claude loads skill names/triggers at startup (minimal overhead)
2. Skill content loads when trigger words detected
3. Full patterns available instantly (no agent invocation needed)

**Trigger Examples**:
```
User: "Where is the invoice validation logic?"
→ haiku-explorer activates → /explore services/finance

User: "Calculate VAT for Bangladesh construction materials"
→ vextrus-domain-expert activates → 15% VAT rate with code snippet

User: "Create checkpoint after Phase 2 completion"
→ production-ready-workflow activates → 300-600 line template

User: "Implement Invoice aggregate with CQRS"
→ graphql-event-sourcing activates → Aggregate + Event + CQRS patterns
```

### Multi-Skill Coordination

Skills can activate together:

**Example**: "Implement Bangladesh invoice with VAT and CQRS"
- ✅ vextrus-domain-expert → VAT 15%, Mushak 6.3, fiscal year
- ✅ graphql-event-sourcing → Invoice aggregate, CQRS handlers
- ✅ production-ready-workflow → Quality gates, testing

---

## Integration with Agents

**Agent-First Philosophy**: Skills supplement agents, don't replace them.

### When to Use Agents vs Skills

**Use Agents** (Primary):
- Code review: `kieran-typescript-reviewer`
- Architecture design: `architecture-strategist`
- Security audit: `security-sentinel`
- Pattern analysis: `pattern-recognition-specialist`
- See `.claude/agents/AGENT-DIRECTORY.md` for all 33 agents

**Use Skills** (Supplementary):
- Instant domain patterns (Bangladesh compliance, Event Sourcing)
- Fast exploration (Haiku 4.5)
- Copy-paste templates (aggregates, GraphQL schemas)
- Checkpoint templates
- Quality gate checklists

**Typical Workflow**:
```
1. /explore services/finance (haiku-explorer skill)
2. Read identified files completely
3. Implement with domain patterns (vextrus-domain-expert skill)
4. Review with agent (kieran-typescript-reviewer agent)
5. Create checkpoint (production-ready-workflow skill)
```

- All v1.0 skills archived to `.claude/skills-archive/`
- Patterns migrated to:
  * VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md (comprehensive technical patterns)
  * v3.0 4 optimized skills (domain-specific)
  * Agent workflows (33 agents for explicit invocation)

**From v2.0** (0 skills):
- Skills restored with 88% optimization
- Hybrid approach: Agent-first + focused skill support
- No breaking changes to agent workflows

**How to Use v3.0**:
1. Continue using agents as primary (agent-first philosophy)
2. Skills activate automatically on trigger words
3. Use skills for instant patterns (no agent invocation needed)
4. Reference VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md for comprehensive patterns
5. Follow workflows in `.claude/workflows/` for task execution

---

## Troubleshooting

**Skills not activating?**
1. Check trigger words: "where", "VAT", "checkpoint", "GraphQL", etc.
2. Restart Claude Code (skills load at startup)
3. Verify `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter exists

**Need more patterns?**
- See `VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md` (17 comprehensive sections)
- See `.claude/agents/AGENT-DIRECTORY.md` (33 agents)

**Context too high?**
- Enable MCP servers on-demand (`/mcp enable github`)
- Disable after use (`/mcp disable github`)
- Load VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md sections as needed (not entire file)
