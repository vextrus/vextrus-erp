## Session Context

**What was accomplished**:
- Phase 1: Infrastructure (TODO, checkpoints, context monitoring docs) ✓
- Phase 2: CLAUDE.md V8.0 (580 lines, 170 enforcement keywords) ✓
- Phase 3: Skills Conversion (official folder/SKILL.md format) ✓

**Critical mistakes found and fixed**:
1. Agent Skills format was wrong → Fixed to official format
2. Context monitoring claimed "auto" but impossible → Fixed to user-driven
3. Thresholds too conservative (70% RED) → Updated to 90% RED

**Remaining work**:
- Phase 4: Plugin Documentation (54 plugins)
- Phase 5: Validation (test workflows, create report)

## START IN PLAN MODE

**User's explicit request**:
> "We'll begin the new session in the plan mode to see how our workflow doing and review our workflow with agents and with the help of mcp servers and agents we'll again deep dive for deep research in the Web and have Fetch more official docs along with some GitHub repository along with reviewing the Phase 4 and Phase 5"

### Plan Mode Workflow

1. **Launch in Plan Mode**
   - User will start session with plan mode command
   - OR: I should proactively suggest entering plan mode

2. **Deep Research Phase**
   ```
   Parallel Research:
   - Launch Explore agents to analyze V8.0 files
   - Use sequential-thinking MCP to analyze workflow logic
   - Use exa-mcp to search web for:
     - Workflow best practices 2025
     - Context management strategies
     - Claude Code workflow patterns
   - WebFetch official docs:
     - Claude Code workflows
     - Plugin best practices
     - Skills optimization
   - Search GitHub for:
     - Successful Claude Code workflows
     - CLAUDE.md examples
     - Context optimization strategies
   ```

3. **V8.0 Review**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md for any remaining issues
   - Review enforcement keywords (170 instances)
   - Verify Skills format correctness
   - Check context monitoring instructions
   - Validate threshold logic

4. **Phase 4 & 5 Review**
   - Examine plugin-command-reference.md structure
   - Plan documentation strategy for 54 plugins
   - Design validation test cases
   - Estimate context requirements

5. **Feed to Plan Agent**
   - Synthesize all research
   - Provide comprehensive context
   - Get structured plan for Phase 4 & 5

6. **Execute Plan**
   - Follow Plan agent's recommendations
   - Complete Phase 4 (Plugin docs)
   - Complete Phase 5 (Validation)
   - Tag v8.0 release

## Recovery Instructions

### To Resume This Session

1. **Read state files**:
   ```bash
   Read .claude/todo/current.md
   Read .claude/checkpoints/2025-10-31-0700-PHASE3-COMPLETE.md
   Read .claude/NEXT-SESSION-PLAN.md (this file)
   ```

2. **Verify context**:
   ```
   User should run: /context
   Current should be: Fresh session (~40-50k baseline)
   ```

3. **Enter plan mode**:
   - User initiates plan mode
   - OR: I suggest: "Let's start in plan mode to review V8.0 as planned"

4. **Execute research**:
   - Launch Explore agents (4 parallel)
   - Use MCP servers (sequential-thinking, exa-mcp)
   - WebFetch official docs
   - Search GitHub repos

5. **Synthesize & plan**:
   - Feed all findings to Plan agent
   - Review proposed plan
   - Execute Phase 4 & 5

## Questions to Answer

1. **V8.0 Workflow**:
   - Are there any other critical mistakes like Skills/context monitoring?
   - Is enforcement protocol too strict or too loose?
   - Are thresholds optimal (70/80/90%)?

2. **Phase 4 (Plugin Docs)**:
   - What's the best structure for 54 plugins?
   - Should we group by category?
   - Tier classifications needed?

3. **Phase 5 (Validation)**:
   - What test cases validate V8.0?
   - How to test context monitoring (user-driven)?
   - How to test agent/plugin enforcement?
