# security-sentinel Agent Card

**Type**: Security Audit
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**When**: Auth, RBAC, sensitive data, external APIs

---

## Quick Invocation

```
I'm running security-sentinel agent to audit security.

Scope: [authentication/RBAC/data-handling]
Files: [list files]

[Use Task tool with subagent_type=compounding-engineering:security-sentinel]
```

---

## What It Does

Audits for:
- Authentication vulnerabilities
- Authorization bypass (RBAC)
- SQL injection
- XSS/CSRF
- Sensitive data exposure
- API security
- Token handling
- Input validation

---

## Use Cases

### ALWAYS Audit When
- ‚úÖ Authentication logic changes
- ‚úÖ RBAC/permissions implementation
- ‚úÖ Payment processing
- ‚úÖ API endpoints handling sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Database queries with user input
- ‚úÖ File uploads/downloads
- ‚úÖ External API integrations

### Skip When
- ‚ùå Internal domain logic (no external input)
- ‚ùå Read-only queries with no user input
- ‚ùå UI components (no data handling)

## Typical Output

```
üîí Security Audit Complete

Severity Breakdown:
- Critical: 0
- High: 1
- Medium: 2
- Low: 3

HIGH Severity:
- invoice.resolver.ts:45 - Missing RBAC check on `deleteInvoice` mutation
  Fix: Add @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RBACGuard) with 'invoice:delete' permission

MEDIUM Severity:
- payment.service.ts:78 - Logging sensitive payment details
  Fix: Redact card numbers in logs

  Fix: Add @MaxLength() decorator

Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è FIX HIGH ISSUES BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
```

## Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate security risk, blocks deployment
- **High**: Serious vulnerability, fix before merge
- **Medium**: Should fix, but not blocking
- **Low**: Nice to have, technical debt

**Deployment Threshold**: 0 Critical, 0 High issues
