# 🔥 POWERHOUSE WORKFLOW V5.0 - The Truth Protocol

> **NO MORE LIES. NO MORE FAKE SUCCESS. ONLY REALITY.**

## 🎯 The New Prime Directives

### 1. The Truth Test
Before claiming ANYTHING works:
```bash
# Can a real user:
- Click it?
- See the change?
- Refresh and still see it?
- Check the database and verify it?

If ANY answer is NO = IT DOESN'T WORK
```

### 2. The One Feature Rule
```yaml
Current Feature: [ONLY ONE]
Status: [NOT STARTED | IN PROGRESS | ACTUALLY WORKING]
Test Results: [REAL BROWSER TEST OUTPUT]
Database Check: [ACTUAL QUERY RESULTS]
```

### 3. The Honesty Protocol
```javascript
// BANNED PHRASES:
"✅ Successfully implemented"  // Unless tested
"Works perfectly"               // Unless proven
"Feature complete"              // Unless user-verified
"Should work"                   // It doesn't
"Might work"                    // It doesn't
"Probably works"                // It doesn't

// REQUIRED PHRASES:
"Broken because..."
"Fails when..."
"Doesn't persist because..."
"Not connected to..."
```

## 🧪 The Testing-First Development Cycle

### Step 1: Define Success (BEFORE CODING)
```markdown
Feature: Create Task
Success Criteria:
1. User clicks "New Task" button
2. Form appears
3. User enters: "Test Task 123"
4. User clicks "Save"
5. Task appears in list
6. Refresh page
7. Task STILL in list
8. Check database: SELECT * FROM tasks WHERE title = 'Test Task 123'
9. Record exists = SUCCESS
```

### Step 2: Test Current State (BEFORE CODING)
```bash
# Run the test FIRST to see it fail
playwright.navigate('/projects/1')
playwright.click('New Task')
# Document EXACTLY what happens
```

### Step 3: Write Minimal Code
```javascript
// ONLY enough to make Step 1 work
// NO EXTRA FEATURES
// NO OPTIMIZATIONS
// NO ABSTRACTIONS
```

### Step 4: Test Again (WITH EVIDENCE)
```bash
# Screenshot before
# Execute test
# Screenshot after
# Database query
# Show actual results
```

## 🚫 The Banned Practices

### 1. The Fake Success
```javascript
// BANNED:
console.log("Feature working ✅")

// REQUIRED:
const test = await playwright.test()
console.log("Test result:", test.actual_output)
```

### 2. The Orphan Code
```javascript
// BANNED:
class AdvancedService {
  // 500 lines of code never called
}

// REQUIRED:
// If not used in 24 hours = DELETE IT
```

### 3. The Complexity Bomb
```javascript
// BANNED:
// Building 12-module architecture before 1 module works

// REQUIRED:
// One working feature > 100 planned features
```

## 📊 The Progress Tracking (HONEST VERSION)

### Daily Reality Check
```yaml
Session: 042
Date: 2025-01-04
Time Spent: 3 hours

Attempted: Fix task creation
Result: FAILED
Reason: Form submits but returns 500 error
Evidence: [screenshot-error-500.png]

Actual Working Features: 3/150
- Login: YES
- View Projects: YES  
- View Tasks: YES
- Create Tasks: NO
- Update Tasks: NO
- Delete Tasks: NO

Honest Progress: 2%
```

## 🔧 The Fix-First Philosophy

### Priority Order (NO EXCEPTIONS)
1. **Make CREATE work** (completely)
2. **Make UPDATE work** (completely)
3. **Make DELETE work** (completely)
4. **Make it persist** (verified in DB)
5. **Make it fast** (if needed)
6. **Make it pretty** (if time)

### The Connection Mandate
```javascript
// Before writing new code, check:
const existingService = await find('src/modules/projects/application/services')
if (existingService.exists && !existingService.connected) {
  CONNECT IT FIRST
} else {
  // Only then write new code
}
```

## 🎮 The MCP Server Usage (PROPER)

### 1. Serena - Code Analysis (USE IT)
```bash
# BEFORE writing anything:
serena.find_symbol('TaskService')
serena.find_references('createTask')
# Find what exists before duplicating
```

### 2. Playwright - Real Testing (USE IT)
```bash
# AFTER every change:
playwright.navigate(url)
playwright.click(button)
playwright.snapshot()  # PROVE it works
```

### 3. Filesystem - Code Cleanup (USE IT)
```bash
# Find dead code:
grep -r "export" --include="*.ts" | grep -v "import"
# If not imported anywhere = DELETE
```

## 📈 The Success Metrics (REAL ONES)

### What Actually Matters
```yaml
Working Features: [count]
Broken Features: [count]
Dead Code Lines: [count]
Test Coverage: [actual %]
User Can Do: [list of real actions]
```

### What Doesn't Matter
```yaml
Lines Written: ❌
Files Created: ❌
Sessions Completed: ❌
Features "Implemented": ❌
Commits Made: ❌
```

## 🔄 The Session Flow (NEW)

### 1. Start with Truth
```bash
# What's actually broken?
playwright.test_current_state()
# Document failures
```

### 2. Pick ONE Thing
```bash
# The smallest broken thing
CURRENT_FIX="Make task title save to database"
# Nothing else
```

### 3. Fix with Evidence
```bash
# Show before state
# Make change
# Show after state
# Verify in database
```

### 4. End with Reality
```markdown
Session Result:
- Attempted: X
- Actually Fixed: Y
- Still Broken: Z
- Next Priority: [ONE THING]
```

## 🚀 The Comeback Plan

### Session 042-045: The Basics
```yaml
042: Make task CREATE actually work
043: Make task UPDATE actually work
044: Make task DELETE actually work
045: Make drag-drop SAVE to database
```

### Session 046-050: The Connections
```yaml
046: Connect CPM service (it exists!)
047: Connect WBS service (it exists!)
048: Connect Weather service (it exists!)
049: Connect RAJUK service (it exists!)
050: Make dependencies actually work
```

### Session 051-055: The Reality
```yaml
051: Delete all dead code
052: Fix all console errors
053: Make it work with 1000 tasks
054: Add real error handling
055: Document what ACTUALLY works
```

## 📝 The New Documentation Standard

### Required for EVERY Session
```markdown
## Evidence of Success
- Before Screenshot: [link]
- After Screenshot: [link]
- Database Query: [actual SQL]
- Database Result: [actual rows]
- User Test: [video/gif of user doing it]

## Evidence of Failure
- Error Screenshots: [all of them]
- Console Errors: [complete list]
- What Doesn't Work: [honest list]
```

## 🎯 The Ultimate Goal

**By Session 50:**
- User can CREATE a task ✓ (actually)
- User can UPDATE a task ✓ (actually)
- User can DELETE a task ✓ (actually)
- Changes PERSIST ✓ (actually)
- Gantt SHOWS changes ✓ (actually)

**Not by Session 50:**
- 12 module architecture
- AI integration
- Real-time collaboration
- Advanced anything

## 🔑 The Success Formula

```
Working Basics > Broken Advanced
Honest Failure > Fake Success
One Feature Complete > Ten Features Started
Tested Truth > Assumed Function
Connected Services > New Services
```

## 💪 The Commitment

From Session 042 forward:
1. **NO LIES** - Test everything, prove everything
2. **NO COMPLEXITY** - Fix basics first
3. **NO ORPHANS** - Connect or delete
4. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - Verify everything
5. **NO FAKE SUCCESS** - Reality only

**This is our comeback. This is our truth. This is POWERHOUSE V5.**

*The workflow that admits failure and builds success.*
