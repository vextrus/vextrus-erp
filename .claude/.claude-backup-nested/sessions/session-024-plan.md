# Session 024: Back to Basics - Make Gantt Chart Actually Work

## Mission
Stop adding features. Fix what's broken. Make the Gantt chart functional, not fancy.

## Current Reality Check

### What We Have
- 56 tasks in database with proper dates (Sep 2025 - Sep 2026)
- 73+ dependencies in database
- CPM service that works
- A Gantt chart that displays but doesn't function
- 2000+ lines of unused "advanced" code

### What's Actually Working
- Task list displays (left panel)
- Some colored bars appear (right panel)
- UI controls render (but don't work)
- Page doesn't crash (usually)

### What's Completely Broken
- Timeline shows 4 days instead of 365 days
- Console spams endlessly
- Can't click anything
- Can't drag anything
- Can't zoom
- No dependency lines
- No critical path highlighting
- 35 FPS performance

## THE NEW APPROACH: Fix Don't Build

### Guiding Principles
1. **NO NEW ARCHITECTURE** - Work with existing GanttRenderer.ts
2. **ONE FIX AT A TIME** - Test each fix before moving on
3. **PLAYWRIGHT FIRST** - Test continuously, not at the end
4. **DELETE UNUSED CODE** - Remove complexity
5. **CONSOLE SILENCE** - No more console.log spam

## Phase-by-Phase Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Emergency Cleanup (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Stop the bleeding

1. **Remove Console Spam**
   ```typescript
   // Find and remove/comment ALL console.log statements in:
   - GanttContainer.tsx
   - GanttRenderer.ts
   - useGanttStore.ts
   ```

2. **Delete Unused Files**
   ```bash
   # Remove failed architecture attempts
   - GanttCanvasManager.ts (unused)
   - GanttInteractionManager.ts (unused)  
   - useGanttCanvas.ts (unused)
   ```

3. **Simplify Render Loop**
   - Remove performance metrics updates
   - Reduce useEffect dependencies
   - Add proper cleanup

4. **Test with Playwright**
   - Verify no console errors
   - Check FPS improved
   - Confirm page responsive

### Phase 2: Fix Timeline Scale (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Show correct date range (Sep 2025 - Sep 2026)

1. **Debug Current Scale**
   ```typescript
   // In GanttRenderer.ts
   - Log project start/end dates
   - Log calculated column count
   - Find why it shows 4 days
   ```

2. **Fix Date Calculations**
   ```typescript
   // Problems to fix:
   - columnWidth calculation for year view
   - Date range calculation
   - Month/week/day view switching
   ```

3. **Adjust View Modes**
   - Day view: Show 30 days
   - Week view: Show 3 months  
   - Month view: Show full year
   - Quarter view: Show 2 years

4. **Test with Playwright**
   - Screenshot each view mode
   - Verify dates are correct
   - Check task bars align with dates

### Phase 3: Make Dependencies Visible (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Show actual dependency arrows

1. **Check Dependency Data**
   ```typescript
   // In GanttContainer.tsx
   - Verify dependencies loaded from API
   - Log dependency count and structure
   - Confirm fromTaskId/toTaskId valid
   ```

2. **Fix Arrow Rendering**
   ```typescript
   // In GanttRenderer.ts renderDependencies()
   - Add console.log to verify function called
   - Check arrow coordinate calculations
   - Verify canvas context state
   ```

3. **Simple Arrow Implementation**
   - Start with straight lines
   - Then add arrow heads
   - Finally add smart routing

4. **Test with Playwright**
   - Count visible arrows
   - Verify arrows connect correct tasks
   - Check critical path arrows are red

### Phase 4: Enable Basic Interactions (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Make ONE interaction work perfectly

1. **Choose Simplest First: Click to Select**
   ```typescript
   // In GanttContainer.tsx handleMouseDown
   - Add visual feedback for selection
   - Highlight selected task
   - Show task details somewhere
   ```

2. **Then Add: Zoom with Buttons**
   ```typescript
   // Don't use mouse wheel yet
   - Make zoom buttons actually work
   - Update columnWidth on zoom
   - Redraw canvas after zoom
   ```

3. **Finally: Simple Pan**
   ```typescript
   // Use scrollbars first
   - Make horizontal scroll work
   - Make vertical scroll work
   - Update canvas on scroll
   ```

4. **Test Each Interaction**
   - Click task → Verify selection
   - Click zoom → Verify scale changes
   - Scroll → Verify canvas updates

### Phase 5: Fix Performance (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Achieve 60 FPS

1. **Profile Current Performance**
   - Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
   - Find render bottlenecks
   - Identify unnecessary redraws

2. **Optimize Render Cycle**
   ```typescript
   // Techniques to apply:
   - Render only visible tasks
   - Cache unchanged elements
   - Use requestAnimationFrame properly
   - Batch DOM updates
   ```

3. **Reduce Re-renders**
   - Memoize expensive calculations
   - Stabilize useEffect dependencies
   - Use useCallback for event handlers

4. **Measure Improvements**
   - Before/after FPS comparison
   - Render time measurements
   - Memory usage check

### Phase 6: Critical Path Highlighting (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Use existing CPM service properly

1. **Verify CPM Data**
   ```typescript
   // Check task.critical flag
   - Log critical task count
   - Verify CPM calculation correct
   ```

2. **Apply Visual Highlighting**
   - Critical tasks: Red bars
   - Critical dependencies: Solid red lines
   - Non-critical: Normal colors

3. **Add Legend**
   - Show what colors mean
   - Display critical path duration
   - Show float for non-critical tasks

### Phase 7: Testing & Documentation (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Verify everything actually works

1. **Comprehensive Playwright Tests**
   ```javascript
   // Test checklist:
   - [ ] Timeline shows full year
   - [ ] All 56 tasks visible
   - [ ] Dependencies displayed
   - [ ] Click selection works
   - [ ] Zoom changes scale
   - [ ] Scroll moves view
   - [ ] Critical path highlighted
   - [ ] 60 FPS achieved
   - [ ] No console errors
   ```

2. **Create Visual Proof**
   - Screenshot working features
   - Record interaction GIFs
   - Document what's fixed

3. **Update Documentation**
   - List working features
   - Note remaining issues
   - Update README

## Success Criteria for Session 024

### Minimum Viable Gantt (Must Have)
- [ ] No console errors or spam
- [ ] Correct timeline scale (1 year project)
- [ ] All 56 tasks visible with correct dates
- [ ] Dependencies shown as arrows
- [ ] Critical path highlighted in red
- [ ] Click to select tasks works
- [ ] 60 FPS performance

### Nice to Have (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Zoom with buttons works
- [ ] Scroll to pan works
- [ ] Task tooltips on hover
- [ ] Different view modes (day/week/month)

### NOT Doing in Session 024
- ❌ Drag to reschedule
- ❌ Resource histograms
- ❌ Export functionality
- ❌ AI features
- ❌ Real-time collaboration
- ❌ New architecture

## Testing Strategy

### After EVERY Change
1. Save file
2. Check browser console (must be clean)
3. Test the specific feature
4. Use Playwright to verify
5. Only move on if working

### Continuous Monitoring
```javascript
// Run these tests continuously
setInterval(() => {
  - Check FPS
  - Count console errors
  - Measure render time
  - Check memory usage
}, 5000)
```

## Risk Mitigation

### If Something Breaks
1. **Git commit before each phase**
2. **Revert if worse than before**
3. **Don't combine fixes**
4. **Test incrementally**

### If Still Not Working
1. **Consider using a library** (e.g., dhtmlx-gantt, gantt-task-react)
2. **Start with minimal example**
3. **Build up gradually**
4. **Don't over-engineer**

## Expected Outcome

By end of Session 024:
- **Gantt chart that actually works** (not just looks good)
- **Core features functional** (not just coded)
- **Performance acceptable** (60 FPS)
- **Users can actually use it** (not just admire it)

## Final Notes

### Remember
- **Working ugly > Broken pretty**
- **One working feature > Ten broken features**
- **Test > Code > Test > Code**
- **Delete more than you add**

### Success Metric
If a user can:
1. See their project timeline correctly
2. Understand task dependencies
3. Identify the critical path
4. Click on tasks for details

Then Session 024 is a SUCCESS.

If we're still writing architecture documents and creating new files, it's a FAILURE.
