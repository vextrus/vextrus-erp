In the current system we had a good foundation like the DDD architecture, backend, frontend foundation etc. but not up to top notch and now we're planning big, so it would be better if we can start from scratch.\\\n\\\nThe next task of yourself  would be mirgration task. End this session here and prepare for comprehensive migration task in the next session.\\\n\\\nWe're in \"C:/Users/riz/vextrus-app\" directory, create a new folder in C:/Users/riz/vextrus-erp and start migration process there.\\\n\\\nThe migration's first task would be mocing out Claude Code files that includes ./.claude/ along with ./sessions folder with right hooks and files. Also mcp servers configuration and optimization for the new project. The first thing I want is a complete setup of CC like it's present in our current system.\\\n\\\nThen you'll be creating files, mainly doc markdown files for the architecture, module planning, folder structure, etc. and a basic theme, then you'll create the very first tasks in details for the foundation from where we can start our journey. Remember to start the new project from scratch, the most benefecial thing can be documentation and planning, if we document everything and plan from the foundation, then we can execute our project step by step, with sessions and task phase wise, if we have a solid foundation.\\\n\\\nAs we were just researching and analyzing for our Project management module plan, it's wuite good. Also, we'll need more modules for our ERP enterprise software like Finance (VVI) and other modules. We had our initial plan in the root folder vextrus-modules-architecture.html and vextrus-technical-architecture.html, based on which we build our current setup. \\\n\\\nVextrus ERP must be an Enterprise ERP software specially customized for Bangladesh Construction and Real Estate field with all modern features that rivals all global jiants, take their advantages, get rid off their disadvantages and combinibg them create a modern AI integrated, easy to learn, user firendly, modern updated UI and UX, specially customized for Bangladesh content.\\\n\\\nThe architecture we're gonna build the new vextrus-app is very important, so you should dive deep into enterprise software architecture like ours and for best modern architecture, research in depth with bravesearch, brightdata and reddit mcp servers, then accumulating all research result, please create a comprehensive plan for the next task migration. \\\n\\\nEnd the task and begin the migration task, also you can keep researching, also it would be better if you just include deep research with mcp servers during the migration task."

With this architecture, companies can implement more agile ERP systems and adapt them to meet changing business needs.(no content)Of the companies that moved into ERP technologies, 78% are using cloud solutions, while only 21% continue to rely on an in-house system. For small and mid-sized companies, the benefits of cloud ERP are clear – lower cost and greater agility.\n\n## Vendor-Specific Approaches\n\n### Microsoft Dynamics 365\nMicrosoft has enhanced its cloud-native functionality, particularly for one of its flagship products, Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O. Microsoft leads in cloud-native capabilities for its F&O product, outpacing other similar products such as SAP S/4 HANA or Oracle Cloud ERP.(no content)Microsoft significantly leads in its cloud-native functionality for Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O, surpassing competitors like SAP S/4 HANA and Oracle Cloud ERP in this regard.\n\n**Key strengths:**\n- Its strengths lie in leveraging AI for advanced insights and support, as well as automating and optimizing operations more effectively than competitors. Plus, Dynamics 365 offers a significant cost advantage over SAP and Oracle solutions.\n- One of the most cost-effective business solutions available on the market today with a reported 265% ROI after three years.\n\n### SAP S/4HANA\nEnterprise-grade companies often prefer the architecture accompanying the S/4 HANA Suite, particularly featuring leading products like SAP SuccessFactors for HCM, SAP Hybris for Commerce, SAP EWM for WMS, Ariba for P2P, and Concur for T&E.(no content)Built on a robust, enterprise-wide architecture, SAP ERP offers a comprehensive set of best practices and thousands of industry-specific solutions developed by SAP and its partners. This helps companies of all sizes accelerate business growth with proven, scalable technology.\n\n**Target market:**\n- Best for large enterprises with complex requirements. This is especially true for industries like manufacturing, chemical, and pharma. Renders in-depth industry-specific functionalities but comes with high costs and complexity.\n\n### Oracle Cloud ERP\nOracle's ERP system now leads the market with a 6.63% market share as of 2024.(no content)Oracle ERP Cloud remains a top choice for large companies across diverse industries, particularly media, telecommunications, construction, energy, oil and gas, and healthcare. Despite the need for internal IT expertise, it is also suitable for companies with a need to integrate various third-party software systems.\n\n**Architecture approach:**\n- Oracle Fusion Cloud ERP: Also based on the cloud, Fusion Cloud ERP offers modular flexibility, allowing businesses to tailor ERP functionalities based on their specific needs.\n\n## 2024 Best Practices\n\n### Architecture Selection\nService-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a flexible approach to software development in which components called \"services\" are created to perform various tasks. Examples include user authentication, payment processing, and invoicing. Companies can use an SOA to reuse services or modules in different systems without writing new code. These services communicate through standardized interfaces, which promotes interoperability between different systems. An SOA also enables the integration of legacy systems with modern applications. The flexibility and interoperability that an SOA provides make it a valuable architectural approach for organizations looking to streamline their systems.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\nUnderstanding your current and future needs. Check if ERP software best practices can optimize non-standard processes before considering customization. Look at each vendor's cloud offerings and determine the best mix of on-premise and cloud components for your business.\n\n### Market Positioning\n- **For Large Enterprises:** For many larger organizations, the choice of ERP vendor comes down to Oracle Cloud ERP vs. SAP. Oracle and SAP together command a majority of the large-enterprise ERP market.\n- **For SMBs:** Microsoft Dynamics 365 is best suited for SMEs but also scalable for larger organizations, especially those already in the Microsoft ecosystem. Lower total cost of ownership (TCO) and quicker implementation times, making it accessible for businesses of all sizes.\n\n### Key Decision Factors\nA Gartner study shows that 75% of ERP projects fail to meet expectations, often due to mismatched solutions or poor implementation strategies.(no content)If you don't have an effective methodology, you can expect a negative impact on your implementation, solution quality, and business satisfaction. Wrong choice of methodology may lead to poor decision-making, best practices may not be followed, and teams may be disjointed in the implementation, which can cause delays.\n\nThe landscape shows Microsoft Dynamics 365 leading in cloud-native microservices architecture, while SAP provides comprehensive enterprise-grade solutions with strong industry-specific features, and Oracle offers flexible, modular approaches with strong market share. The trend is clearly toward cloud-based, microservices architectures that provide greater agility and lower costs for organizations of all sizes."
