# Cost & Performance Analysis

## Model Performance Comparison

| Model | SWE-bench | Speed | Cost |
|-------|-----------|-------|------|
| Haiku 4.5 | 73% | 2x faster | 1/3 cost |
| Sonnet 4.5 | 77% | Baseline | Baseline |

## Cost Comparison

### Manual File Reading (Sonnet 4.5)
```
Read 10 files Ã— 500 lines = 5,000 lines
Input cost: ~$0.05
Time: 3-5 minutes
Context: 5,000 lines loaded
```

### /explore with Haiku 4.5
```
/explore services/finance
Input cost: ~$0.015
Time: 1-2 minutes
Context: 200-500 lines of insights
Result: Comprehensive understanding + file list
```

**Savings**: 60-70% cost reduction, 50% time savings
