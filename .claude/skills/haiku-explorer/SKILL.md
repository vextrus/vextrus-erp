# Haiku Explorer Skill

## Purpose
**Fast codebase exploration** using Haiku 4.5 before implementation. Optimized for large codebases like Vextrus ERP (18 microservices, 900k+ lines).

**Why Haiku**:
- 73% SWE-bench (vs Sonnet 77%)
- 2x faster execution
- 1/3 cost
- Perfect for exploration phase

---

## When to Use

✅ **Use /explore When**:
- Unfamiliar with codebase area
- Need to find relevant files (>3 files)
- Understanding code flow
- Multi-service tasks
- "Where is X?" questions

❌ **Skip When**:
- Exact file location known (1-2 files)
- Simple config changes
- User provides specific paths

---

## Thoroughness Levels

### Quick (Default)
```bash
/explore services/finance
```
- Basic structure, main files
- Time: 30-60 seconds
- Use for: Simple tasks, orientation

### Medium
```bash
/explore services/finance/src/domain
```
- Specific path, detailed analysis
- Time: 1-2 minutes
- Use for: Feature implementation

### Very Thorough
```bash
/explore services/finance --thorough
```
- Comprehensive, cross-references
- Time: 2-3 minutes
- Use for: Complex refactoring, system-wide changes

## Vextrus ERP Structure

### Service Organization
```
services/
├── finance/           ← /explore services/finance
│   ├── src/domain/      ← Aggregates, entities
│   ├── application/     ← Commands, queries, handlers
│   └── infrastructure/  ← GraphQL, TypeORM, clients
├── master-data/
├── notification/
└── [15 more services]
```

### Exploration by Layer
```bash
# Domain layer (business logic)
/explore services/finance/src/domain

# Application layer (CQRS)
/explore services/finance/src/application

# Infrastructure layer (GraphQL, DB)
/explore services/finance/src/infrastructure/graphql
```

---

## Common Exploration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature Location
```
User: "Where is invoice validation logic?"
→ /explore services/finance "validation"
→ Result: invoice.aggregate.ts, invoice-validation.service.ts
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Service Task
```
User: "Implement payment-invoice linking"
→ /explore services/finance (payment patterns)
→ /explore services/master-data (customer data)
→ Read identified files, implement
```

### Pattern 3: GraphQL Schema
```
User: "Find Invoice GraphQL type"
→ /explore services/finance "type Invoice"
→ Result: invoice.resolver.ts, invoice.schema.graphql
```

### Pattern 4: Event Sourcing
```
User: "Where are invoice events?"
→ /explore services/finance "InvoiceEvent"
→ Result: invoice-created.event.ts, invoice-approved.event.ts
```

---

## Integration with Workflow

**Standard Workflow** (Simple to Medium tasks):
```
1. /explore services/[name] (2-5 min)
2. Read identified files COMPLETELY (10-30 min)
3. Implement (1-6 hours)
4. Test → Commit
```

**Complex Workflow**:
```
1. Parallel /explore (2-3 agents, 2 min)
2. Planning agents (architecture-strategist, 30 min)
3. Read files (30-60 min)
4. Implement with checkpoints (multi-day)
5. Review agents (kieran-typescript-reviewer, 30 min)
```

---

## Context Optimization

**Problem**: 18 services × 50k lines = 900k lines (exceeds 200k token limit)

**Solution**: Explore first, read precisely

**Savings**:
- Without exploration: Read 10-20 files blindly (8,500 lines avg)
- With exploration: Read 3-5 identified files (1,200 lines avg)
- **Result**: 86% context reduction

**Example**:
```
Task: "Fix VAT calculation"

Without /explore:
- Read all finance service files (45 min, 8,500 lines)
- Find VAT logic buried in file #15
- Total context: High

With /explore:
- /explore services/finance "VAT" (2 min)
- Read vat-calculation.service.ts (300 lines)
- Fix immediately
- Total context: Low (86% savings)
```

---

## Multi-Service Exploration

For cross-service features, explore in parallel:

```
Launch parallel explorations:
1. /explore services/finance
2. /explore services/master-data
3. /explore services/notification

Complete in ~1 min (vs 3 min sequential)
```

**Use agents for parallelization** (see [Agent Directory](../../agents/AGENT-DIRECTORY.md))

---

## Vextrus-Specific Tips

### Finding Aggregates
```bash
/explore services/finance "aggregate"
→ Invoice, Payment, Journal aggregates
```

### Finding Events
```bash
/explore services/finance "Event"
→ InvoiceCreatedEvent, PaymentAllocatedEvent, etc.
```

### Finding GraphQL Types
```bash
/explore services/finance "@key"
→ Federated entities (Invoice, Payment, etc.)
```

### Finding Multi-Tenant Code
```bash
/explore services/finance "tenantId"
→ Tenant context usage across layers
```

### Finding Bangladesh Compliance
```bash
/explore services/finance "VAT"
→ VAT calculation, TDS withholding, Mushak generation
```

## Quick Reference

| Task | Exploration Command | Time | Result |
|------|-------------------|------|--------|
| Bug fix | `/explore services/[name] "[feature]"` | 1 min | 1-3 files |
| New feature | `/explore services/[name]` | 2 min | 3-5 files |
| Refactoring | `/explore services/[name] --thorough` | 3 min | 5-10 files |
| Multi-service | Parallel /explore (agents) | 1 min | 10-15 files |

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Always explore before reading (>3 files)
- Use quick exploration for simple tasks
- Use thorough exploration for refactoring
- Parallel exploration for multi-service
- Read identified files COMPLETELY (not partial)

❌ **Don't**:
- Read blindly without exploration
- Skip exploration for "familiar" code
- Use very thorough for simple tasks
- Read entire service for 1-file bugs
- Assume file location (verify with /explore)
