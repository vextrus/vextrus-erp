**Quick Reference**: How to use v4.0 for daily development of Vextrus ERP

---

## Starting a New Task (Initial Prompt Template)

### For Simple Tasks (<4 hours)

```
I need to [task description].

Context:
- Service: [finance/crm/hr/etc.]
- Files likely affected: [list if known]
- Estimated time: [1-4 hours]

Please:
1. Read the relevant files completely
2. Implement using VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md patterns
3. Run quality gates (pnpm build && npm test)
4. Commit with proper message

Note: This is a simple task, no GitHub integration needed.
```

**Example**:
```
I need to add a new field "paymentTerms" to the Invoice aggregate.

Context:
- Service: finance
- Files: services/finance/src/domain/invoice/invoice.aggregate.ts
- Estimated time: 2 hours

Please:
1. Read the Invoice aggregate completely
2. Add the field following Event Sourcing patterns
3. Update tests
4. Run quality gates and commit
```

---

### For Medium Tasks (4-8 hours)

```
I need to [task description].

Context:
- Service: [finance/crm/hr/etc.]
- Scope: [what's included]
- Estimated time: [4-8 hours]

Please use Plan Mode:
1. /explore [service] to understand current implementation
2. Read identified files completely
3. Create implementation plan with TodoWrite
4. Execute systematically
5. Quality review: kieran-typescript-reviewer (MANDATORY)
6. Optional: Create GitHub issue for tracking

Reference: .claude/github/task-templates/medium-task-template.md
```

**Example**:
```
I need to implement payment reconciliation feature in the finance service.

Context:
- Service: finance
- Scope: ReconciliationService, bank statement parsing, payment-invoice matching
- Estimated time: 6 hours

Please use Plan Mode:
1. /explore services/finance to understand payment and invoice structures
2. Read relevant files completely
3. Create plan with TodoWrite (8-12 tasks)
4. Implement using VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md (DDD, Event Sourcing, CQRS)
5. Quality review: kieran-typescript-reviewer
6. Create GitHub issue #[number] for tracking (optional)
```

---

### For Complex Tasks (Multi-day, 2-5 days)

```
I need to [feature description].

Context:
- Feature: [name]
- Services involved: [list]
- Estimated time: [2-5 days]
- GitHub Issue: #[number] (create if doesn't exist)

MANDATORY: Use full v4.0 workflow
1. Plan Mode (Day 0): Research + Design + TodoWrite (8-15 tasks)
2. Create checkpoint-day0-plan.md (will auto-sync to issue #[number])
3. Consider git worktree if parallel work possible
4. Execute systematically with daily checkpoints
5. Quality reviews: kieran-typescript-reviewer + 2-3 specialized agents
6. Final checkpoint + comprehensive PR

Reference: .claude/github/task-templates/complex-task-template.md
```

**Example**:
```
I need to implement invoice-payment linking with automatic reconciliation.

Context:
- Feature: Invoice-Payment Linking
- Services: finance (Invoice, Payment, Reconciliation aggregates)
- Estimated time: 3-5 days
- GitHub Issue: #245 (create if doesn't exist)

MANDATORY: Use full v4.0 workflow
1. Plan Mode: Research payment/invoice architecture, design reconciliation logic
2. Create checkpoint-day0-plan.md (auto-syncs to #245)
3. Git worktree: Consider parallel development (backend/frontend/tests)
4. Execute: Implement domain → application → presentation layers
5. Daily checkpoints: checkpoint-day1-end.md, checkpoint-day2-end.md, etc.
6. Quality reviews: kieran-typescript-reviewer, security-sentinel, performance-oracle
7. Final: checkpoint-final-complete.md + create PR

Reference VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md sections: Event Sourcing, CQRS, DDD, Bangladesh Compliance
```

## During Development

### Quality Gates (Automatic)

**Pre-Commit** (Husky hooks run automatically):
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add payment reconciliation"

# Automatically runs:
# 1. lint-staged (format + lint)
# 2. TypeScript type check
# 3. Tests (if test files changed)
# ❌ Blocks commit if failures
```

**PR Quality Gates** (GitHub Actions run automatically):
- Quality score calculated (0-10)
- TypeScript errors checked
- Tests run, coverage measured
- Agent review recommended if PR >500 lines
- **Blocks merge if quality <7.0/10**

**No manual action needed** - automation handles it ✅

---

### Creating Checkpoints

**When to create**:
- **Complex tasks only** (simple/medium don't need checkpoints)
- End of each day (for multi-day features)
- After major milestones (domain layer complete, etc.)
- Final checkpoint (feature complete)

**Naming convention**:
```
checkpoint-day0-plan.md          # Initial planning
checkpoint-day1-start.md         # Start of day 1
checkpoint-day1-end.md           # End of day 1
checkpoint-day2-end.md           # End of day 2
checkpoint-review-domain.md      # After quality review
checkpoint-final-complete.md     # Feature complete
```

**How to create**:
```
Create checkpoint for [phase/milestone].

Include:
- Date, time, branch, issue number
- What was accomplished
- Code changes made
- Quality metrics (tests, coverage, reviews)
- Next steps
- Any blockers

Format: 200-600 lines comprehensive summary
```

**Auto-sync** (v4.0 automation):
- Push checkpoint file → Automatically syncs to GitHub issue
- No manual sync needed ✅

**Manual sync** (if needed):
```bash
./.claude/github/scripts/sync-checkpoint.sh checkpoint-day2.md 245
```

---

## Context Management

### When Context Gets High (>100k tokens)

**Option 1: Checkpoint + New Session** (Recommended for complex tasks)

```
# In current session:
Create a comprehensive checkpoint for current progress.

Include:
- All work completed so far
- Current state of implementation
- Files modified (with key changes)
- Tests passing/failing
- Next steps (remaining tasks)
- Important context to preserve

Save as: checkpoint-[feature-name]-session[N].md

# In new session:
Continue from checkpoint-[feature-name]-session[N].md

Please:
1. Read the checkpoint file completely
2. Read current state of modified files
3. Continue implementation from where we left off
4. Reference previous context as needed
```

**Example**:
```
# Current session (context at 150k):
Create checkpoint for invoice-payment linking progress.

Include:
- Day 1-2 work: Domain layer complete (Payment aggregate)
- Files: services/finance/src/domain/payment/*.ts
- Tests: 15 passing (domain layer)
- Quality: kieran-typescript-reviewer 9/10
- Next: Application layer (CQRS handlers)

Save as: checkpoint-invoice-payment-session1.md

# New session (fresh context):
Continue from checkpoint-invoice-payment-session1.md

Domain layer complete (9/10 quality, 15 tests passing).
Next: Implement application layer (CQRS command/query handlers).

Please:
1. Read checkpoint-invoice-payment-session1.md
2. Read services/finance/src/domain/payment/ files
3. Continue with application layer implementation
```

---

**Option 2: Compact Context** (For medium tasks)

```
Please compact context by creating a brief summary of work so far.

Include only:
- Key decisions made
- Files modified (names only)
- Current implementation state
- Immediate next steps

Keep to <100 lines.
```

---

**Option 3: Start Fresh with Clear Instructions** (For simple tasks)

```
# If previous work was committed:
I need to continue working on [task].

Current state:
- Branch: feature/[name]
- Last commit: [hash or description]
- Remaining work: [what's left]

Please:
1. Check git status to see current state
2. Review last commit to understand what was done
3. Continue from there
```

---

## Git Worktree (For Complex Parallel Work)

**When to use**:
- Multi-day feature (>8 hours total)
- Independent parallel work possible
- Example: Backend + Frontend + Tests can be done in parallel

**Setup**:
```bash
# Create worktrees
./.claude/github/scripts/create-worktree.sh invoice-backend finance
./.claude/github/scripts/create-worktree.sh invoice-frontend web
./.claude/github/scripts/create-worktree.sh invoice-tests tests

# Work in parallel (3 separate Claude instances)
# Terminal 1: cd ../vextrus-invoice-backend && claude
# Terminal 2: cd ../vextrus-invoice-frontend && claude
# Terminal 3: cd ../vextrus-invoice-tests && claude
```

**Initial prompt for each worktree**:
```
# In backend worktree:
I'm working in a git worktree for backend development.

Context:
- Worktree: ../vextrus-invoice-backend
- Branch: feature/finance-invoice-backend
- Scope: Domain + Application layers only
- Estimated: 6-8 hours

Please implement backend logic, referencing VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md for DDD, Event Sourcing, CQRS patterns.
```

**Cleanup** (after merging):
```bash
cd ~/vextrus-erp
git merge feature/invoice-backend
git merge feature/invoice-frontend
git merge feature/invoice-tests
./.claude/github/scripts/cleanup-worktrees.sh invoice-*
```

---

## Handling Errors and Blockers

### Pre-Commit Hook Failing

**TypeScript errors**:
```
# Fix TypeScript errors first
pnpm build

# Or skip hook (EMERGENCY ONLY)
git commit --no-verify
```

**Test failures**:
```
# Fix tests first
npm test

# Or skip hook (EMERGENCY ONLY)
git commit --no-verify
```

---

### PR Blocked by Quality Gates

**Quality score <7.0**:
1. Check PR comment for specific issues
2. Fix TypeScript errors: `pnpm build`
3. Fix test failures: `npm test`
4. Improve coverage if <70%
5. Push fixes → Quality gates re-run automatically

**Agent review recommended**:
```
# In Claude Code:
Run kieran-typescript-reviewer agent on changed files.

Scope: Review for quality, patterns, best practices
Files: [list changed files]

Target: 9.5/10 quality score
```

---

### Context Limit Reached Mid-Task

**Immediate action**:
```
URGENT: Context limit approaching.

Create emergency checkpoint NOW:
- Current progress summary
- Files modified + key changes
- Immediate next steps (1-3 specific tasks)
- Critical context to preserve

Save as: checkpoint-emergency-[timestamp].md

Keep to 200-300 lines maximum.
```

**Continue in new session**:
```
Continue from checkpoint-emergency-[timestamp].md

Context limit was reached. Checkpoint created.

Please:
1. Read emergency checkpoint
2. Resume exactly where we left off
3. Complete remaining tasks
```

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Build & Test
pnpm build              # Must pass (0 TypeScript errors)
npm test                # Must pass (all tests green)

# GitHub MCP (enable only when needed)
/mcp enable github      # For creating issues, syncing checkpoints
/mcp disable github     # Disable after use (save context)

# Context monitoring

## Tips for Maximum Efficiency

### 1. Always Start with Context
```
Context:
- What: [task description]
- Where: [service/files]
- Time: [estimate]
- Complexity: [simple/medium/complex]
```

### 2. Reference Patterns Proactively
```
Reference VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md sections:
- Event Sourcing (section 3)
- CQRS (section 4)
- GraphQL Federation v2 (section 5)
- Bangladesh Compliance (sections 11-13)
```

### 3. Use Agents Explicitly
```
# Medium tasks:
After implementation, run kieran-typescript-reviewer for quality review.

# Complex tasks:
Quality reviews:
- kieran-typescript-reviewer (MANDATORY)
- security-sentinel (if auth/RBAC)
- performance-oracle (if caching/queries)
```

### 4. Trust the Automation
```
# Don't manually:
- Run lint/format (pre-commit does it)
- Sync checkpoints (GitHub Actions does it)
- Calculate quality score (PR gates do it)
- Collect metrics (automatic on merge)

# Just:
- Write good code
- Commit when ready
- Let automation handle the rest
```

### 5. Monitor Context
```
# Check context periodically:
/context

# If >100k, create checkpoint and start new session
# Target: Keep <100k for smooth operation
```

## Common Patterns

### Starting Fresh (New Feature)
```
New feature: [name]
Service: [service]
Estimated: [time]
Complexity: [simple/medium/complex]

[Use appropriate template from above]
```

### Continuing Work (Same Day)
```
Continue [feature name].

Current state: [brief summary]
Next: [immediate next steps]

[Let Claude continue from context]
```

### Continuing Work (Next Day/New Session)
```
Continue from checkpoint-[name].md

[If checkpoint exists, reference it]
[If no checkpoint, describe current state + next steps]
```

### Stuck/Blocked
```
I'm stuck on [specific issue].

Context:
- What I tried: [attempts]
- Error/problem: [description]
- Expected: [what should happen]

Please help debug and provide solution.
```
