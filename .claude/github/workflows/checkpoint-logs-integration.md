# Checkpoint-Logs Integration with GitHub Issues

**Purpose**: Comprehensive progress tracking for complex multi-day features
**Use For**: Complex tasks (2-5 days), multi-worktree development, team visibility
**Pattern**: Checkpoint ‚Üí Sync ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Continue

---

## Overview

**Checkpoint-Driven Development** (proven 9.5/10 quality) + **GitHub Issues** (team visibility) = Comprehensive feature tracking

**Benefits**:
- **Asynchronous collaboration**: Team can review checkpoints offline
- **Progress visibility**: GitHub issue becomes single source of truth
- **Context preservation**: Full checkpoint history preserved
- **Review integration**: Link checkpoints to PR reviews
- **Metrics tracking**: Measure actual vs estimated time

---

## When to Use

‚úÖ **Use checkpoint-logs integration when**:
- Multi-day features (2-5 days)
- Multiple developers/stakeholders need visibility
- High-stakes features requiring review gates
- Git worktree parallel development (3+ worktrees)
- Budget/timeline tracking important

‚ùå **Skip for**:
- Simple tasks (<4 hours)
- Solo work with no stakeholders
- Exploratory/learning tasks
- Internal refactoring (no external visibility needed)

---

## Workflow Pattern

### Phase 1: Initial Planning (Day 0)

**1.1 Create GitHub Issue**

```typescript
// Use GitHub MCP tool
mcp__github__create_issue({
  owner: "your-org",
  repo: "vextrus-erp",
  title: "feat: Implement invoice-payment linking with reconciliation",
  body: `
## Goal
Implement comprehensive invoice-payment linking feature with automatic reconciliation

## Scope
- Payment aggregate (Event Sourcing)
- Reconciliation aggregate (cross-aggregate coordination)
- GraphQL resolvers (Federation v2)
- Integration tests (CQRS flows)
- E2E tests (GraphQL mutations/queries)

## Estimated Time
3-5 days (wall-clock)

## Quality Gates
- [ ] kieran-typescript-reviewer: 9.5/10+ quality
- [ ] security-sentinel: 100% pass
- [ ] performance-oracle: <300ms response
- [ ] Test coverage: 90%+ (domain layer)

## Dependencies
- Invoice service (completed)
- Payment gateway integration (in progress)

## Stakeholders
- @finance-team (business requirements)
- @dev-lead (technical review)
  `,
  labels: ["feature", "finance", "complex"]
})
```

**1.2 Enter Plan Mode**

Follow `.claude/github/workflows/plan-mode-workflow.md`:
1. Research (30-90 min) - Parallel agents
2. Analyze (30-60 min) - Read files completely
3. Design (30-90 min) - Architectural decisions
4. TodoWrite (15-30 min) - 8-15 structured tasks
5. **Checkpoint** (30-60 min) - Create `checkpoint-day0-plan.md`

**1.3 Sync Planning Checkpoint**

```bash
# Sync planning checkpoint to GitHub issue
./.claude/github/scripts/sync-checkpoint.sh checkpoint-day0-plan.md 123

# Or use GitHub MCP directly
mcp__github__add_issue_comment({
  owner: "your-org",
  repo: "vextrus-erp",
  issue_number: 123,
  body: "## Day 0: Planning Complete\n\n[checkpoint content]"
})
```

---

### Phase 2: Daily Execution (Day 1-4)

**2.1 Start-of-Day Checkpoint** (15-30 min)

Create `checkpoint-dayN-start.md`:

```markdown
# Day N Start Checkpoint

Create `checkpoint-final-complete.md` (300-600 lines):

```markdown
# Final Checkpoint: Invoice-Payment Linking Feature Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Duration**: 5 days (planned), 4.5 days (actual)
**Branch**: feature/invoice-payment-linking
**Issue**: #123
**PR**: #456

## Executive Summary

Implemented comprehensive invoice-payment linking feature with:
- Cross-aggregate coordination (Invoice + Payment + Reconciliation)
- Event Sourcing + CQRS architecture
- GraphQL Federation v2 resolvers
- 45 tests (92% coverage)
- Proven quality (9.5/10 average)

./.claude/github/scripts/sync-checkpoint.sh checkpoint-main-day2.md 123

# In backend worktree (../vextrus-invoice-backend)
./.claude/github/scripts/sync-checkpoint.sh checkpoint-backend-day2.md 123

# In frontend worktree (../vextrus-invoice-frontend)
./.claude/github/scripts/sync-checkpoint.sh checkpoint-frontend-day2.md 123
```

**Result**: GitHub issue #123 shows progress from all 3 worktrees

## Best Practices

### Checkpoint Frequency

**Too Infrequent** (<1 per day):
- Lose context between checkpoints
- Hard to track daily progress
- Difficult to identify when issues started

**Too Frequent** (>2 per day):
- Overhead not worth it
- Context switching cost
- Diminishing returns

**Optimal** (2 per day for complex tasks):
- Start-of-day (15-30 min) - Set goals
- End-of-day (30-60 min) - Document accomplishments

### Checkpoint Content

**Always Include**:
- Date, time, branch, issue number
- Accomplishments (what was done)
- Quality metrics (tests, coverage, reviews)
- Next steps (what's coming)
- Blockers (if any)

**Optionally Include**:
- Code snippets (key algorithms)
- Architecture diagrams (for complex features)
- Performance benchmarks
- Lessons learned

**Never Include**:
- Sensitive data (credentials, API keys)
- Customer PII (personal information)
- Complete code dumps (use links instead)

### GitHub Issue Structure

**Issue Body**:
- Goal (what we're building)
- Scope (what's included/excluded)
- Estimated time
- Quality gates
- Dependencies
- Stakeholders

**Issue Comments** (checkpoints):
- Day 0: Planning checkpoint
- Day 1: Start + End checkpoints
- Day 2: Start + End checkpoints
- Day N: Start + End checkpoints
- Reviews: Quality review checkpoints
- Final: Comprehensive final checkpoint

**Issue Labels**:
- `feature` - New functionality
- `finance` / `crm` / etc. - Domain area
- `complex` - Multi-day feature
- `checkpoint-driven` - Using checkpoint workflow

---

## Metrics and Analytics

**From GitHub Issues**:
- Planned vs actual time (estimate accuracy)
- Quality review scores (9.5/10 average target)
- Checkpoint frequency (2 per day optimal)
- Blocker frequency (minimize to <1 per feature)

**From Checkpoints**:
- Daily velocity (tasks completed per day)
- Quality gate pass rate (target 100%)
- Rework percentage (target <5%)
- Test coverage trends (target 90%+)

**Example Analysis** (from 10 complex features):
- Average planned time: 4.2 days
- Average actual time: 3.8 days (10% under estimate)
- Average quality score: 9.5/10
- Average rework: <5%
- Average test coverage: 92%

## Troubleshooting

**Checkpoint not syncing?**
```bash
# Check GitHub MCP status
/mcp status

# Enable GitHub MCP
/mcp enable github

# Try sync again
./.claude/github/scripts/sync-checkpoint.sh checkpoint-day2.md 123
```

**GitHub CLI not found?**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
# Windows: winget install --id GitHub.cli
# macOS: brew install gh
# Linux: See https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

**Checkpoint too large for comment?**
- Split into multiple comments
- Link to gist instead
- Summarize in comment, link to full checkpoint in PR

**Lost checkpoint history?**
```bash
# Checkpoints committed to git
git log --all --grep="checkpoint"

# Find checkpoint files
find . -name "checkpoint-*.md"
```

---

## Integration with PR Workflow

**Link checkpoints to PR description**:

```typescript
mcp__github__create_pull_request({
  owner: "your-org",
  repo: "vextrus-erp",
