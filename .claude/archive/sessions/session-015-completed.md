# Session 015 - Project Module Fix Attempt (PARTIAL)

## Date: 2025-01-02

## Summary
Attempted to fix critical issues from Session 014. Made progress on some areas but several critical issues remain.

## Tasks Attempted

### ‚úÖ Partially Completed
1. **Task Form Context Errors** - Removed FormProvider dependency, but form still has input issues
2. **WBS Service Integration** - Added to API but needs testing
3. **Kanban Persistence** - Added status field to API schema but drag-drop not working

### ‚ùå Not Completed
4. Build Custom Interactive Gantt Chart with D3.js
5. Integrate CPM Service for Critical Path
6. Add Weather Impact Visualization
7. Integrate RAJUK Workflow Component
8. Test All Features with Playwright MCP

## Critical Issues Remaining

### üî¥ BLOCKING ISSUES
1. **Task Form Input Problem** - Cannot type in "Task Title" field
2. **Task Creation Fails** - Form validation or submission not working
3. **WBS Generation** - Untested, likely not working
4. **Kanban Drag-Drop** - Not functioning despite API fix

### Root Causes Identified
- Form validation issues with Zod schema coercion
- Missing proper event handlers in form inputs
- Drag-and-drop library integration issues
- Lack of systematic testing with Playwright

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Task Form (src/components/tasks/task-form.tsx)
- Removed FormProvider dependency
- Added z.coerce for number fields
- Issue: Input fields not accepting text

### 2. Task API (src/app/api/v1/tasks/[id]/route.ts)
- Added `status` field to updateTaskSchema
- Issue: Not tested with actual drag-drop

### 3. Task Creation API (src/app/api/v1/projects/[id]/tasks/route.ts)
- Integrated WBS service
- Issue: Not tested, form can't submit

## Playwright Testing Insights

### What Worked Well
- Navigation and authentication testing
- Identifying form errors quickly
- Console error detection

### What Needs Improvement
- Need to test EVERY change immediately
- Use browser_evaluate for complex form interactions
- Check network requests for API failures

## Next Session Requirements

### MANDATORY APPROACH
1. **Start with Playwright** - Test existing state first
2. **Fix One Thing at a Time** - Don't move on until current issue works
3. **Test After Every Change** - No assumptions about what works

### Priority Order for Session 016
1. Fix Task Form input issue (can't type in title)
2. Test and verify task creation with WBS
3. Fix Kanban drag-drop with proper testing
4. Only then move to Gantt/CPM/Weather/RAJUK

## Files to Review
- `/src/components/tasks/task-form.tsx` - Input handling broken
- `/src/components/projects/kanban/kanban-board.tsx` - Drag-drop not working
- `/src/app/api/v1/projects/[id]/tasks/route.ts` - WBS integration untested
- `/src/app/api/v1/tasks/[id]/route.ts` - Status update untested

## Lessons Learned
1. **Never assume a fix works** - Always test with Playwright
2. **Form issues need careful debugging** - Check event handlers, validation, and state
3. **API changes need immediate testing** - Use network tab to verify
4. **One feature at a time** - Complete one before starting another

## Session Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUES REMAIN
