- ✅ Connected to `POST /api/v1/projects`
- ✅ API endpoint exists
- ⚠️ Not manually tested yet

**EDIT** - `/projects/[id]/edit` page exists  
- ✅ Page accessible
- ✅ Form pre-fills with data
- ✅ Connected to `PUT /api/v1/projects/[id]`
- ✅ API endpoint exists
- ⚠️ Not manually tested yet

**DELETE** - Delete button in project cards
- ✅ Delete button visible in menu
- ✅ Confirmation dialog component exists
- ✅ Connected to `DELETE /api/v1/projects/[id]`
- ✅ API endpoint exists
- ⚠️ Not manually tested yet

### Gantt Chart Page
- ✅ Route exists: `/projects/[id]/gantt`
- ✅ Page component exists
- ✅ API endpoint `/api/v1/projects/[id]/gantt` exists
- ⚠️ Visualization not verified
- ⚠️ Library integration unknown

### Task Management
- ✅ 36 tasks exist in database
- ✅ API endpoints exist for task CRUD
- ⚠️ No UI for task management
- ⚠️ Task list view not implemented

## 🔴 NOT WORKING / NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Resource Management
- ❌ No resource allocation UI
- ❌ No resource dashboard
- ✅ API endpoints exist but unused

### Advanced Features

- ❌ Export functionality (buttons exist but non-functional)
- ❌ MS Project/Primavera export
- ❌ Critical Path visualization in UI
- ❌ Weather impact tracking UI
- ❌ RAJUK approval workflow UI

### E2E Tests
- ❌ Most tests failing due to:
  - Wrong password in dashboard tests
  - Missing data-testid attributes
  - Timeout issues

## 📊 ACTUAL METRICS

| Feature | Claimed | Reality | Evidence |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| Build Status | ✅ | ✅ | Build completes successfully |
| Database | ✅ | ✅ | 10 projects, 36 tasks in DB |
| Authentication | ✅ | ✅ | Can login/logout |
| View Projects | ✅ | ✅ | List displays correctly |
| Create Project | ✅ | ⚠️ | UI exists, not tested |
| Edit Project | ✅ | ⚠️ | UI exists, not tested |
| Delete Project | ✅ | ⚠️ | UI exists, not tested |
| Gantt Chart | ✅ | ⚠️ | Page exists, visualization unknown |
| Task Management | ✅ | 🔴 | No UI for tasks |
| Resource Management | ✅ | ❌ | No UI at all |
| Real-time Updates | ✅ | ❌ | Not implemented |
| Export Features | ✅ | ❌ | Not functional |

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Must Test Manually (30 mins)
1. **Create Project**: Navigate to /projects/new, fill form, submit
2. **Edit Project**: Click edit on any project, modify, save
3. **Delete Project**: Click delete, confirm, verify removal
4. **Gantt Chart**: Navigate to /projects/[id]/gantt, check if renders

### Quick Wins (1 hour)
1. Fix dashboard test password
2. Add data-testid attributes to key elements
3. Write one working E2E test for project CRUD
4. Verify Gantt chart library integration

### Should Implement (2 hours)
1. Basic task list view at `/projects/[id]/tasks`
2. Task creation form
3. Connect task UI to existing APIs
4. Fix DeleteConfirmationDialog if needed

## 💡 HONEST ASSESSMENT

**The Good**:
- Core infrastructure is solid (DB, Auth, APIs)
- Build process works
- Basic CRUD UI components exist
- Project list view is fully functional

**The Reality**:
- CRUD operations have UI but are untested
- Many claimed features have APIs but no UI
- System is about 60% complete, not 100%
- Needs 2-3 more hours to be truly functional

**The Path Forward**:
1. Test existing CRUD operations manually
2. Fix any issues found during testing
3. Add basic task management UI
4. Write at least 3 working E2E tests
5. Update documentation with truth

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before claiming features work:
- [ ] Manually click through entire flow
- [ ] Verify data persists in database
- [ ] Check UI provides feedback
- [ ] Ensure errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Write at least one E2E test
- [ ] Document any limitations

---

**Bottom Line**: The system has good bones but needs testing and completion of UI for existing API endpoints. With 2-3 hours of focused work, the Project Module can be genuinely functional.
