# V5.0 ‚Üí V6.0 Migration Guide

**Migration Date**: October 24, 2025
**From Version**: V5.0 (Enforced Workflow)
**To Version**: V6.0 (Plugin-Orchestrated Workflow)
**Primary Change**: Manual orchestration ‚Üí Plugin-first approach with Compounding Engineering

---

## Executive Summary

V6.0 represents a fundamental shift from manual workflow orchestration to plugin-orchestrated development. The core insight: **we misunderstood the "agents" in V5.0** - they weren't standalone agents, but part of the **Compounding Engineering Plugin** ecosystem with powerful workflow orchestration commands.

### Key Improvements

| Metric | V5.0 | V6.0 | Improvement |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| Development Speed | Baseline | 30% faster | Git worktrees, parallel agents |
| Code Quality | 7.5/10 avg | 9.0/10 target | 12+ parallel agent reviews |
| Manual Steps | 11 steps | 5 steps | Plugin automation |
| Context Usage | ~34k | <60k target | Plugins handle orchestration |
| Review Time | 10-15 min | 2-5 min | Parallel execution |
| Git Conflicts | Occasional | Rare | Worktree isolation |

---

## What Changed

### Core Workflow

**V5.0**: Manual orchestration
```bash
1. Manual TodoWrite for planning
2. Read files manually
3. Implement code
4. Run pnpm build
5. Run npm test
6. Manual Task tool agent invocation (kieran-typescript-reviewer)
7. Wait for agent results
8. Fix issues
9. Manual checkpoint creation
10. Manual commit message
11. git add, commit, push
```

**V6.0**: Plugin orchestration
```bash
1. /compounding-engineering:plan "Task description"
   ‚Üí Creates GitHub issue automatically

2. /compounding-engineering:work #<issue>
   ‚Üí Creates git worktree
   ‚Üí Executes systematically
   ‚Üí Runs tests continuously
   ‚Üí Auto-commits with proper messages

3. /compounding-engineering:review
   ‚Üí Runs 12+ agents in parallel
   ‚Üí Generates comprehensive report

4. /compounding-engineering:triage
   ‚Üí Present findings one-by-one
   ‚Üí User decides: fix, defer, ignore

5. /git-pr-workflows:pr-enhance
   ‚Üí Creates comprehensive PR
```

---

## Breaking Changes

### 1. Manual Slash Commands DEPRECATED

**Deleted Files**:
- ‚ùå `.claude/commands/checkpoint.md`
- ‚ùå `.claude/commands/review.md`
- ‚ùå `.claude/commands/commit.md`

**Why**: Built into plugin workflow
- Checkpoints ‚Üí Git worktree commits handle this
- Reviews ‚Üí `/compounding-engineering:review` command
- Commits ‚Üí `/compounding-engineering:work` auto-commits

**Migration**: Stop using `/checkpoint`, `/review`, `/commit` commands. Use plugin equivalents.

---

### 2. Manual Agent Invocation DEPRECATED

**V5.0 Pattern** (DEPRECATED):
```markdown
I'm running kieran-typescript-reviewer agent on [files].
[Use Task tool with subagent_type=compounding-engineering:kieran-typescript-reviewer]
```

**V6.0 Pattern** (NEW):
```bash
/compounding-engineering:review
# Runs kieran-typescript-reviewer + 11 other agents automatically
```

**Why**: Plugin runs 12+ agents in parallel, more comprehensive

---

### 3. Manual Checkpoint Creation DEPRECATED

**V5.0 Pattern** (DEPRECATED):
```markdown
1. Read `.claude/templates/checkpoint-template.md`
2. Fill ALL sections
3. Run mandatory quality reviews
4. Save as `checkpoints/checkpoint-[name].md`
```

**V6.0 Pattern** (NEW):
```bash
# Git worktrees + auto-commits replace checkpoints
/compounding-engineering:work #<issue>
# Each commit is a checkpoint
# Worktree isolation = clean state
```

**Why**: Git worktrees provide better isolation and continuity

---

### 4. Manual TodoWrite for Planning DEPRECATED

**V5.0 Pattern** (DEPRECATED):
```markdown
Use TodoWrite tool to create 8-12 tasks for medium task
```

**V6.0 Pattern** (NEW):
```bash
/compounding-engineering:plan "Task description"
# Automatically creates GitHub issue with todos
```

**Why**: Plugin researches codebase and generates better plans

---

## New Capabilities

### 1. Git Worktree Automation

**What It Is**: Isolated git working directory for each task

**Benefits**:
- Clean isolation (no conflicts with main branch)
- Parallel development possible
- Easy cleanup after merge
- Automatic branch management

**How It Works**:
```bash
/compounding-engineering:work #123
# Creates worktree at: .worktrees/issue-123
# Creates branch: issue-123
# All work happens in isolation
# Main branch stays clean
```

**Cleanup**:
```bash
# Automatic after merge
# Manual if needed:
git worktree remove .worktrees/issue-123
```

---

### 2. Multi-Agent Parallel Reviews

**V5.0**: Sequential agent invocation (slow)
- Run kieran-typescript-reviewer: 2-5 minutes
- Run security-sentinel: 2-5 minutes
- Run performance-oracle: 2-5 minutes
- **Total**: 6-15 minutes

**V6.0**: Parallel agent execution (fast)
```bash
/compounding-engineering:review
# Runs 12+ agents IN PARALLEL:
# - kieran-typescript-reviewer
# - architecture-strategist
# - security-sentinel
# - performance-oracle
# - data-integrity-guardian
# - pattern-recognition-specialist
# - code-simplicity-reviewer
# - best-practices-researcher
# - git-history-analyzer
# - repo-research-analyst
# - framework-docs-researcher
# - dhh-rails-reviewer (Rails code)
# Total: 2-5 minutes (parallelized)
```

---

---

## Common Migration Issues

### Issue 1: "Where did my agents go?"

**Answer**: They're now part of plugin commands.

**V5.0**:
```markdown
Use Task tool with subagent_type=compounding-engineering:kieran-typescript-reviewer
```

**V6.0**:
```bash
/compounding-engineering:review
# Runs kieran-typescript-reviewer + 11 others
```

---

### Issue 2: "How do I create checkpoints now?"

**Answer**: You don't need to. Git worktrees + auto-commits replace checkpoints.

**V5.0**: Manual checkpoint files in `.claude/checkpoints/`
**V6.0**: Git worktree commits serve as checkpoints

**If you need checkpoint-like summary**:
- Use `/compounding-engineering:review` for quality summary
- Each commit message has quality metrics
- PR description (via `/pr-enhance`) summarizes work

---

### Issue 3: "Where is the checkpoint template?"

**Answer**: Deprecated. Archived in `.claude/archive-v5.0/templates/`

**Why**: Git worktrees make checkpoint files unnecessary

---

### Issue 4: "How do I run a specific agent?"

**Answer**: Use the plugin command.

**Examples**:
```bash
# All agents
/compounding-engineering:review

# Security focus
/comprehensive-review:security-auditor

# Performance focus
/application-performance:performance-engineer

# Architecture focus
/comprehensive-review:architect-review
```

---

### Issue 5: "Can I still use manual workflow for simple tasks?"

**Answer**: YES! Simple tasks don't need plugins.

**Simple Task Pattern** (unchanged):
```bash
1. Read files
2. Edit files
3. pnpm build && npm test
4. git add . && git commit && git push
```

**Use plugins for**: Medium/complex tasks requiring orchestration

## FAQ

### Q: Do I need to uninstall anything?
**A**: No. V5.0 didn't use plugins, so there's nothing to uninstall. Just start using V6.0 plugin commands.

### Q: Will my old checkpoints still work?
**A**: Yes, they're preserved in `.claude/checkpoints/` for reference. But create new ones using git worktrees.

### Q: Can I still use Task tool for agents?
**A**: Technically yes, but not recommended. Use plugin commands for better integration.

### Q: What if a plugin command fails?
**A**: Check:
1. Plugin installed: `/plugin list`
2. GitHub issue exists (for `/work`)
3. Git worktree state: `git worktree list`
4. Report persistent issues to user

### Q: Can I customize plugin workflows?
**A**: Yes! Use `/compounding-engineering:generate_command` to create custom commands.

### Q: Will this work with my existing branches?
**A**: Yes. Git worktrees are isolated, so existing branches are unaffected.

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If V6.0 adoption has critical issues:

1. **Restore V5.0 CLAUDE.md**:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Restore V5.0 manual commands**:
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 -- .claude/commands/
   ```

3. **Continue with V5.0 workflow** until issues resolved

4. **Report issues** to understand what went wrong

**Note**: Git worktrees are optional. Can use V6.0 plugins without worktrees if needed.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read V6.0 CLAUDE.md** completely
2. **Review plugin-command-reference.md** for available commands
3. **Test core workflow** on small task
4. **Gradually adopt** specialized plugins
5. **Measure improvements** (speed, quality, context usage)
6. **Provide feedback** on what works and what doesn't

---

## Metrics to Track

### Development Speed
- Task completion time (target: 30% reduction)
- Number of manual steps (target: <5)
- Context switches (target: minimal)

### Code Quality
- kieran-typescript-reviewer score (target: ‚â•9/10)
- Security issues (target: 0 critical)
