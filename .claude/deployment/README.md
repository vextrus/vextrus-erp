## Rollback Procedure

If deployment fails:

```bash
# Automatic rollback (within 5 min window)
gh workflow run rollback.yml --ref main

# Manual rollback

git push origin main
gh workflow run deploy-automated.yml
```

**Rollback triggers**:
- Smoke tests fail
- Error rate >1%
- Response time >500ms
- Database connection errors

## Monitoring

**Prometheus Metrics**: http://prometheus.vextrus.com
**Grafana Dashboards**: http://grafana.vextrus.com
**Logs**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

**Key Metrics**:
- Request rate (requests/second)
- Error rate (% of requests)
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Database connections (active/idle)

**Alerts** (PagerDuty):
- Error rate >1% (critical)
- Response time >500ms (warning)
- Database down (critical)
- Kafka down (critical)
