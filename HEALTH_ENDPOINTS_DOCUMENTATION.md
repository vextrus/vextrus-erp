## Services with No Working Health Endpoints

### ❌ Workflow Service (Port 3011)
- **Status:** Service running but health endpoints not accessible
- **Tested Paths:** `/health`, `/api/health`, `/api/v1/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`
- **All Paths Return:** 404 Not Found
- **Issue:** Health module present in code but endpoints not registered properly

### ❌ Rules Engine Service (Port 3012)
- **Status:** Service running but health endpoints not accessible
- **Tested Paths:** `/health`, `/api/health`, `/api/v1/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`
- **All Paths Return:** 404 Not Found
- **Issue:** Health module present in code but endpoints not registered properly

## Endpoint Path Analysis

| Path | Success Rate | Working Services |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `/api/v1/health` | 40.0% (2/5) | Auth, Master Data |
| `/health` | 20.0% (1/5) | API Gateway |
| `/health/live` | 20.0% (1/5) | API Gateway |
| `/health/ready` | 20.0% (1/5) | API Gateway |
| `/api/health` | 0.0% (0/5) | None |

## Issues Identified

### 1. Workflow Service Health Endpoints Not Working
**Problem:** Despite having a complete health module with controller, the endpoints return 404.
**Files Confirmed Present:**
- `services/workflow/src/modules/health/health.controller.ts`
- `services/workflow/src/modules/health/health.module.ts`
- Health module imported in `app.module.ts`

**Possible Causes:**
- Route registration issue
- Module import problem
- Global prefix configuration

### 2. Rules Engine Service Health Endpoints Not Working
**Problem:** Same issue as Workflow service - health module exists but endpoints not accessible.
**Files Confirmed Present:**
- `services/rules-engine/src/modules/health/health.controller.ts`
- `services/rules-engine/src/modules/health/health.module.ts`
- Health module imported in `app.module.ts`

### 3. Inconsistent Health Endpoint Patterns
**Current Patterns:**
- Auth & Master Data: `/api/v1/health`
- API Gateway: `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready`
- Expected but not working: `/health`, `/health/live`, `/health/ready` for other services

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Workflow Service Health Endpoints:**
   - Debug route registration
   - Verify module imports
   - Check for conflicting routes

2. **Fix Rules Engine Service Health Endpoints:**
   - Same troubleshooting steps as Workflow service
   - Ensure consistent implementation

3. **Standardize Health Endpoint Patterns:**
   - Consider using `/health` as primary endpoint
   - Implement `/health/live` and `/health/ready` for Kubernetes compatibility
   - Add `/api/v1/health` for API versioning consistency

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Enable Port Mapping for Internal Services:**
   - Consider exposing health endpoints for monitoring
   - Implement service discovery for health checks

2. **Start Missing Services:**
   - Import-Export Service (3007)
   - File Storage Service (3008)
   - Organization Service (3016)

3. **Implement Comprehensive Health Checks:**
   - Database connectivity
   - External service dependencies
   - Memory and resource usage
   - Application-specific health indicators

## Monitoring Integration
Services with working health endpoints can be integrated with:
- **Kubernetes Probes:** Use `/health/live` and `/health/ready`
- **Prometheus Monitoring:** Scrape `/health` for metrics
- **Load Balancers:** Use health endpoints for routing decisions
- **Service Discovery:** Register healthy service instances

## Next Steps
1. Debug and fix Workflow service health endpoint registration
2. Debug and fix Rules Engine service health endpoint registration
3. Verify health endpoints work correctly after fixes
4. Implement monitoring integration for all working endpoints
5. Document health check implementation patterns for new services
