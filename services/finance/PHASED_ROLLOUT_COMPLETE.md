## Docker Build Challenges & Solutions

### Issue: Complex Monorepo + Heavy ML Dependencies

**Problem:**
The production Dockerfile includes heavy ML dependencies (TensorFlow, NumPy, scikit-learn, Python scientific stack) and complex monorepo structure, causing:
- Long build times (10+ minutes)
- Build failures due to dependency complexities
- Large image size

**Root Causes:**
1. Multi-stage build requires building shared packages first
2. ML libraries require system-level dependencies (Python, GCC, build-essential, etc.)
3. Monorepo structure with workspace dependencies
4. Bengal language support (fonts, tesseract-ocr) adds system packages

### Solutions (Choose One):

#### Option 1: Simplified Local Build (Recommended for Testing)
**File**: `services/finance/Dockerfile.local`
**Pros**: Fast builds, minimal dependencies
**Cons**: No ML features
**Use Case**: Local Kubernetes testing, development

```bash
docker build -t vextrus/finance:week1-local -f services/finance/Dockerfile.local .
```

#### Option 2: Pre-build Shared Packages
Build shared packages separately before building the service:

```bash
# Build shared packages first
cd shared/infrastructure && pnpm build
cd ../cache && pnpm build

# Then build finance service
cd ../../services/finance
docker build -t vextrus/finance:week1-prod -f Dockerfile --target production ../..
```

#### Option 3: Use CI/CD Pipeline
Set up GitHub Actions or similar to build with proper caching and resources:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build-finance.yml
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: .
    file: services/finance/Dockerfile
    target: production
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

#### Option 4: Docker Compose for Local Dev
Use existing docker-compose.yml for local development without K8s:

```bash
docker-compose up finance
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Grafana Dashboard
**URL**: `https://grafana.vextrus.com/d/finance-week1`

**Panels**:
1. Request Rate (Canary vs Stable)
2. Error Rate Comparison
3. P95 Latency Comparison
4. Pod Health & Restarts
5. Resource Usage (CPU/Memory)

### Prometheus Alerts

**Critical** (Auto-rollback):
- üö® Error rate >1% for 5 minutes
- üö® Pod crash loop detected
- üö® Health checks failing

**Warning**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Canary error rate 50% higher than stable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory usage >85%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è P95 latency >500ms

### Manual Monitoring

```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n vextrus-production -l app=finance-service

# View canary logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/finance-service-week1 -n vextrus-production

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n vextrus-production -l version=week1

# Run smoke tests anytime
./services/finance/k8s/04-smoke-tests.sh production
```

---

## Emergency Rollback

### Automated Rollback
Prometheus alerts trigger automatic rollback if:
- Error rate >1% for 5 minutes
- Pod crash loop detected
- Critical health check failures

### Manual Rollback (5 minutes)

```bash
# Option 1: Scale down canary (keeps for investigation)
kubectl scale deployment/finance-service-week1 -n vextrus-production --replicas=0

# Option 2: Delete canary completely
kubectl delete deployment finance-service-week1 -n vextrus-production

# Option 3: Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/finance-service-week1 -n vextrus-production

# Or use the rollback script
./services/finance/k8s/rollback-week1.sh
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Docker Build)

Choose one of the Docker build options above and build the image:

```bash
# Option 1: Simplified Local Build (Fastest)
docker build -t vextrus/finance:week1-local -f services/finance/Dockerfile.local .

# Then proceed with deployment
kubectl apply -f services/finance/k8s/02-production-week1-canary.yaml
```

### After Week 1 Deployment (48 hours monitoring)

1. **Monitor metrics** per schedule:
   - Hour 0-6: Every 15-30 minutes
   - Hour 6-24: Every hour
   - Hour 24-48: Every 2 hours

2. **Validate success criteria**:
   - Error rate <0.5%
   - P95 latency <500ms
   - 0 incidents
   - 0 rollbacks

3. **If successful, deploy Week 2**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t vextrus/finance:week2-prod -f services/finance/Dockerfile.local .
   kubectl apply -f services/finance/k8s/05-production-week2-30percent.yaml
   ```

### After Week 2 (48 hours monitoring)

1. Monitor and validate same criteria
2. If successful, create Week 3 manifest (60%)
3. Continue phased rollout to 100%
