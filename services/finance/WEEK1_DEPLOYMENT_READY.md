## üöÄ Deployment Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Staging Deployment (10 minutes)
```bash
cd services/finance

# Build Docker image
docker build -t vextrus/finance:week1-staging -f Dockerfile --target production .

# Deploy to staging
kubectl apply -f k8s/01-staging-deployment.yaml

# Wait for rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/finance-service-staging -n vextrus-staging
```

### Phase 2: Staging Validation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Run smoke tests
export STAGING_JWT_TOKEN="<your-token>"
./k8s/04-smoke-tests.sh staging

# Expected: ALL TESTS PASSED ‚úÖ
```

### Phase 3: Production Canary Deployment (15 minutes)
```bash
# Tag for production
docker tag vextrus/finance:week1-staging vextrus/finance:week1-prod
docker push vextrus/finance:week1-prod

# Deploy canary (10% traffic)
kubectl apply -f k8s/02-production-week1-canary.yaml

# Setup monitoring
kubectl apply -f k8s/03-monitoring-serviceMonitor.yaml

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods -n vextrus-production -l app=finance-service
```

### Phase 4: Production Validation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Run smoke tests
export PROD_JWT_TOKEN="<your-token>"
./k8s/04-smoke-tests.sh production

# Expected: ALL TESTS PASSED ‚úÖ
```

### Phase 5: 48-Hour Monitoring
**Active monitoring of**:
- Error rate (target: <0.5%)
- P95 latency (target: <500ms)
- Pod health & restarts
- Resource usage
- Security alerts

**Monitoring Schedule**:
- Hour 0-6: Every 15-30 minutes
- Hour 6-24: Every hour
- Hour 24-48: Every 2 hours

## üìä Monitoring Dashboard

**Access**: https://grafana.vextrus.com/d/finance-week1

**Key Metrics**:
1. **Request Rate** (Canary vs Stable)
2. **Error Rate** (Target: <0.5%)
3. **P95 Latency** (Target: <500ms)
4. **Pod Health** (Restarts, crashes)
5. **Resource Usage** (CPU, Memory)

**Alerts Configured**:
- üö® Critical: Error rate >1% for 5 min ‚Üí Auto-rollback
- üö® Critical: P95 latency >500ms for 5 min
- üö® Critical: Pod crash loop detected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Memory usage >85%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Canary error rate 50% higher than stable

---

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
Prometheus alerts trigger automatic rollback if:
- Error rate >1% sustained for 5 minutes
- Pod crash loop detected
- Critical health check failures

### Manual Rollback (5 minutes)
```bash
# Option 1: Scale down canary
kubectl scale deployment/finance-service-week1 -n vextrus-production --replicas=0

# Option 2: Delete canary completely
kubectl delete deployment finance-service-week1 -n vextrus-production

# Option 3: Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/finance-service-week1 -n vextrus-production
```

**Post-Rollback Actions**:
1. Verify stability returned
2. Collect failure logs
3. Investigate root cause
4. Plan remediation
5. Update team
