## Test Coverage Analysis

### 1. Full Payment Workflow (Happy Path) - 2 Tests

**Test 1.1**: Complete Full Invoice Payment Workflow
```typescript
// Workflow: Create → Approve → Pay → Verify PAID status
- Creates invoice with construction materials (10,000 BDT + 15% VAT = 11,500 BDT)
- Approves invoice (status: DRAFT → APPROVED)
- Creates and completes full payment (11,500 BDT)
- Verifies payment status: COMPLETED
- Verifies invoice status: PAID
- Verifies balances: paidAmount = 11,500, balanceAmount = 0
- Verifies paidAt timestamp populated
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Invoice status transitions correctly (DRAFT → APPROVED → PAID)
- Payment status transitions correctly (PENDING → COMPLETED)
- Paid amount and balance amount calculated correctly
- paidAt timestamp recorded when fully paid
- Cross-aggregate coordination works (Payment → Invoice)

**Test 1.2**: VAT Calculation Verification
```typescript
// Validates Bangladesh standard VAT rate (15%)
- Creates invoice with steel rebar (50 * 200 BDT = 10,000 BDT)
- Verifies subtotal: 10,000 BDT
- Verifies VAT (15%): 1,500 BDT
- Verifies grand total: 11,500 BDT
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- VAT calculation accuracy (15% Bangladesh standard)
- Subtotal + VAT = Grand Total
- Money value object calculations
- Currency handling (BDT)

---

### 2. Partial Payment Handling - 2 Tests

**Test 2.1**: Partial Payment (Status Remains APPROVED)
```typescript
// Scenario: Pay 50% of invoice total
- Creates invoice: 20,000 BDT + 15% VAT = 23,000 BDT
- Makes partial payment: 11,500 BDT (50%)
- Verifies invoice status: APPROVED (NOT PAID)
- Verifies paidAmount: 11,500 BDT
- Verifies balanceAmount: 11,500 BDT
- Verifies paidAt: undefined (not fully paid)
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Invoice status does NOT transition to PAID on partial payment
- Paid amount accumulates correctly
- Balance amount calculated correctly (grandTotal - paidAmount)
- paidAt only set when fully paid

**Test 2.2**: Multiple Line Items with Different VAT Amounts
```typescript
// Scenario: Complex invoice with 3 line items
- Line 1: Cement (100 * 500 BDT = 50,000 BDT)
- Line 2: Sand (10 * 1,500 BDT = 15,000 BDT)
- Line 3: Bricks (5 * 8,000 BDT = 40,000 BDT)
- Subtotal: 105,000 BDT
- VAT (15%): 15,750 BDT
- Grand Total: 120,750 BDT
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Line item aggregation (quantity * unitPrice)
- VAT calculation on total subtotal (not per-line)
- Complex invoice handling with multiple products
- Line item persistence in projection

---

### 3. Multiple Payments Accumulation - 2 Tests

**Test 3.1**: Accumulate Multiple Payments → PAID Status
```typescript
// Scenario: Three payments to complete invoice
- Invoice: 30,000 BDT + 15% VAT = 34,500 BDT
- Payment 1: 10,000 BDT → Status: APPROVED, Balance: 24,500 BDT
- Payment 2: 14,500 BDT → Status: APPROVED, Balance: 10,000 BDT
- Payment 3: 10,000 BDT → Status: PAID, Balance: 0 BDT
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Multiple payments accumulate correctly
- Status transitions to PAID only when balance = 0
- Each payment updates paidAmount incrementally
- Balance amount recalculated after each payment

**Test 3.2**: Exact Payment Completion
```typescript
// Scenario: Last payment exactly fills remaining balance
- Invoice: 5,000 BDT + 15% VAT = 5,750 BDT
- Payment 1: 3,000 BDT → Balance: 2,750 BDT
- Payment 2: 2,750 BDT (exact balance) → Status: PAID, Balance: 0 BDT
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Exact balance payment handling
- Zero balance detection (isZero() method)
- Precision in balance calculations
- Status transition on exact match

### 4. Overpayment Prevention - 2 Tests

**Test 4.1**: Prevent Single Overpayment

- Attempt payment: 15,000 BDT (exceeds grand total)
- Expected: InvoiceOverpaymentException thrown
- Verify: Invoice unchanged (paidAmount = 0, status = APPROVED)
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Overpayment detection (paidAmount > grandTotal)
- InvoiceOverpaymentException thrown correctly
- Invoice state not modified on exception
- Transactional consistency (rollback on error)

**Test 4.2**: Prevent Overpayment on Subsequent Payments
```typescript
// Scenario: Second payment would exceed remaining balance
- Invoice: 10,000 BDT + 15% VAT = 11,500 BDT
- Payment 1: 8,000 BDT → Balance: 3,500 BDT
- Attempt Payment 2: 5,000 BDT (exceeds remaining 3,500 BDT)
- Expected: InvoiceOverpaymentException thrown
- Verify: Invoice unchanged (paidAmount = 8,000, balance = 3,500)
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Overpayment detection on cumulative payments
- Remaining balance validation before recording payment
- Previous payments not affected by failed payment attempt
- Graceful degradation (partial payments preserved)

---

### 5. Payment Failure Handling - 1 Test

**Test 5.1**: Payment Failure Does Not Affect Invoice
```typescript
// Scenario: Payment fails (insufficient funds)
- Invoice created and approved
- Payment created and linked to invoice
- Payment failed (FailPaymentCommand)
- Verify payment status: FAILED
- Verify invoice unchanged: paidAmount = 0, status = APPROVED, paidAt = undefined
```

**Business Rules Validated**:
- Payment failure does not trigger invoice update
- Failed payments not recorded on invoice
- Invoice remains in APPROVED status
- Eventual consistency maintained (failed payment ignored)

---

  - invoiceId
  - paymentId
  - paymentAmount: 5,000 BDT
  - newPaidAmount: 5,000 BDT
  - remainingAmount: 6,500 BDT
```

**Event Sourcing Patterns Validated**:

  - invoiceId
  - finalPaymentId
  - totalPaidAmount: 11,500 BDT
  - paidAt timestamp
```

**Event Sourcing Patterns Validated**:

## Integration Points Tested

### 1. Invoice Aggregate ↔ Payment Aggregate
**Pattern**: Cross-aggregate coordination via domain events

**How It Works**:
1. Payment aggregate completes (emits PaymentCompletedEvent)
2. CompletePaymentHandler loads Invoice aggregate
3. Invoice.recordPayment() called (domain method)
4. Invoice emits InvoicePaymentRecordedEvent
5. Invoice may emit InvoiceFullyPaidEvent (if balance = 0)
6. InvoiceProjectionHandler updates read model

**Tests Validating**:
- Test 1.1: Full payment workflow
- Test 2.1: Partial payment handling
- Test 3.1: Multiple payments accumulation
- Test 10.1: Cross-aggregate consistency

---

### 2. Command Handlers ↔ Domain Logic
**Pattern**: Command handlers coordinate domain logic, aggregates enforce business rules

**How It Works**:
1. GraphQL resolver receives mutation
2. Command created with validated input
3. CommandBus dispatches to handler
4. Handler loads aggregate from EventStore
5. Aggregate executes business logic (throws exceptions on violations)
6. Handler saves aggregate to EventStore
7. Handler publishes domain events to EventBus

**Tests Validating**:
- Test 4.1: Overpayment prevention (exception thrown)
- Test 4.2: Overpayment on subsequent payments
- Test 5.1: Payment failure handling

---

### 3. Event Bus ↔ Projection Handlers
**Pattern**: Event-driven projections for read models

**How It Works**:
1. Domain events published to EventBus
2. Projection handlers subscribe to specific events
3. Handlers update read model (TypeORM entities)
4. Cache invalidated after projection update
5. Queries read from optimized projections (not aggregates)

**Tests Validating**:
- Test 6.1: InvoicePaymentRecordedEvent emission
- Test 6.2: InvoiceFullyPaidEvent emission
- Test 10.2: Projection consistency after multiple events

---

### 4. EventStore ↔ Read Models
**Pattern**: Event sourcing with CQRS projections

**How It Works**:
1. Write side: Aggregates persist events to EventStore
2. Read side: Projections built from events into PostgreSQL
3. Queries execute against read models (fast, optimized)
4. Temporal queries possible (replay events to any point in time)

**Tests Validating**:
- All tests verify projection consistency
- Test 10.2: Projection accuracy after event replay

---

### 5. Multi-Tenant Isolation
**Pattern**: Tenant-scoped data access at all layers

**How It Works**:
1. TenantMiddleware extracts tenant ID from JWT
2. All commands/queries require tenant ID
3. Repository methods filter by tenant ID
4. EventStore streams prefixed with tenant ID
5. Projections indexed by tenant ID
6. Cache keys scoped by tenant ID

**Tests Validating**:
- Test 8.1: Cross-tenant access prevention
