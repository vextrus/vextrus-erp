## 🔄 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Build Docker Image

Choose one of the following approaches:

**Option A: Simplified Local Build (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /c/Users/riz/vextrus-erp
docker build -t vextrus/finance:week4-prod-final -f services/finance/Dockerfile.local .
```

**Option B: Full Production Build**
```bash
# Pre-build shared packages
cd shared/infrastructure && pnpm build
cd ../cache && pnpm build
cd ../..

# Build production image
docker build -t vextrus/finance:week4-prod-final -f services/finance/Dockerfile --target production .
```

**Option C: CI/CD Pipeline**
- Set up GitHub Actions with proper caching
- Use multi-stage builds
- Cache shared dependencies
- Run tests before building

### 2. Push to Registry (If Using External Registry)
```bash
# Tag image
docker tag vextrus/finance:week4-prod-final your-registry.com/vextrus/finance:week4-prod-final

# Push to registry
docker push your-registry.com/vextrus/finance:week4-prod-final

# Update deployment image
kubectl set image deployment/finance-service-production -n vextrus-production \
  finance-service=your-registry.com/vextrus/finance:week4-prod-final
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

After building and pushing the image, pods will automatically pull and start:

```bash
# Watch pods come online
kubectl get pods -n vextrus-production -l track=production -w

# Wait for rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/finance-service-production -n vextrus-production

# Verify all pods are ready
kubectl get pods -n vextrus-production -l track=production
```

### 4. Run Smoke Tests
```bash
# Set JWT token
export PROD_JWT_TOKEN="your-jwt-token"

# Run smoke tests
cd services/finance/k8s
./04-smoke-tests.sh production
```

### 5. Monitor for 48-72 Hours

**Hour 0-6**: Check every 15-30 minutes
```bash
# Check error rate
kubectl logs -n vextrus-production -l track=production --tail=100 | grep -i error

# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n vextrus-production -l track=production

# Check HPA scaling
kubectl get hpa finance-service-production-hpa -n vextrus-production
```

**Hour 6-24**: Check every hour
**Hour 24-72**: Check every 2-4 hours
