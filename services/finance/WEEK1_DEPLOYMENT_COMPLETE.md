## Security Validation

### Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

1. **Code Injection (eval)**
   - **Before**: `eval()` used in automated journal entries (CRITICAL)
   - **After**: mathjs library with input validation (SECURE)
   - **Validation**: No eval() usage detected in codebase

2. **CSRF Protection**
   - **Before**: Disabled (CRITICAL)
   - **After**: Enabled in production with Apollo headers (SECURE)
   - **Validation**: Production config requires preflight headers

3. **CORS Wildcard**
   - **Before**: Potential wildcard or permissive config (HIGH)
   - **After**: Strict origin validation, no wildcards (SECURE)
   - **Validation**: Test confirmed - unauthorized origins blocked

4. **Hardcoded Credentials**
   - **Before**: Database password fallback present (CRITICAL)
   - **After**: Environment-only, no fallbacks (SECURE)
   - **Validation**: No hardcoded secrets in codebase

### Security Score: 85/100 ⭐

- Critical Issues: 0 (was 4)
- High Issues: 0
- Medium Issues: Minor (line endings)
- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
- Build: Successful with no errors
