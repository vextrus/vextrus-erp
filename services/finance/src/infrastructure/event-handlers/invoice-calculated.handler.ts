/**
 * InvoiceCalculated Event Handler
 *
 * Handles InvoiceCalculatedEvent to update financial totals in the PostgreSQL read model.
 * This event is triggered after line items are added or modified, recalculating all financial fields.
 *
 * Data Flow:
 * 1. Invoice.recalculateTotals() â†’ InvoiceCalculatedEvent emitted
 * 2. EventStore persists event to invoice stream
 * 3. Event bus dispatches event to this handler
 * 4. Handler updates InvoiceReadModel financial fields (subtotal, VAT, grand total, etc.)
 *
 * Financial Calculations (Bangladesh):
 * - Subtotal: Sum of all line item amounts
 * - VAT: Based on Bangladesh NBR rates (15%, 7.5%, 5%, 0%)
 * - Supplementary Duty: Additional tax on specific goods
 * - Advance Income Tax: Withholding tax deducted at source
 * - Grand Total: Subtotal + VAT + Supplementary Duty - Advance Income Tax
