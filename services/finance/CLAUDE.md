# Finance Service CLAUDE.md

## Purpose
Enterprise-grade financial management service for Bangladesh construction and real estate ERP system.

## Narrative Summary
The Finance Service implements a complete financial management system using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture with event sourcing. Built on NestJS with TypeScript strict mode, it provides comprehensive financial operations including accounting, invoicing, payments, and regulatory compliance for Bangladesh market requirements. The service uses EventStore DB for event sourcing, enabling full audit trails and temporal queries essential for financial data integrity.

## API Endpoints

### REST Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Comprehensive health check with database and EventStore status
- `GET /health/ready` - Readiness probe with service metadata
- `GET /health/live` - Liveness probe for Kubernetes

### GraphQL Federation
- GraphQL endpoint available at `/graphql`
- Integrated with Apollo Federation v2 for microservice composition
- Schema auto-generated and federated with other services

### Key GraphQL Queries (Phase 2 Complete)

#### Account Balance & Trial Balance
- `trialBalance(input: GetTrialBalanceInput): TrialBalanceType` - Generate trial balance report
  - Verifies debits = credits (double-entry accounting)
  - Groups by account type (ASSET, LIABILITY, EQUITY, REVENUE, EXPENSE)
  - Cached for 30 minutes (Redis)
  - Performance target: <500ms for 10,000 accounts

#### Invoices
- `invoice(id: ID!): InvoiceDto` - Get single invoice by ID
- `invoices(...filters): [InvoiceDto!]!` - List invoices with pagination
- Invoice payment tracking with auto-status transition to PAID

#### Payments
- `payment(id: ID!): PaymentDto` - Get single payment by ID
- `payments(...filters): [PaymentDto!]!` - List payments with filters
- Payment-invoice linking with graceful degradation

#### Journal Entries
- `journal(id: ID!): JournalEntryDto` - Get single journal entry
- `journals(...filters): [JournalEntryDto!]!` - List journal entries
- Unposted journals query for draft management

#### Chart of Accounts
- `chartOfAccount(id: ID!): ChartOfAccountDto` - Get single account
- `chartOfAccounts(...filters): [ChartOfAccountDto!]!` - List accounts by type
- `accountByCode(accountCode: String!): ChartOfAccountDto` - Lookup by account code

## Core Services (Phase 2 Day 7-8)

### AccountBalanceService
**Purpose**: Query pre-calculated account balances (NO runtime SUM operations)

**Key Methods**:
- `getAccountBalance(tenantId, accountId)` - Get single account balance
- `getAccountBalanceByCode(tenantId, accountCode)` - Lookup by account code
- `getAccountsBalanceByType(tenantId, accountType)` - List balances by type
- `getTotalBalanceByType(tenantId, accountType)` - Sum balances for account type
- `getAllActiveAccountBalances(tenantId)` - Get all active accounts (for trial balance)

**Performance Pattern**:
- Balances are pre-calculated by `AccountProjectionHandler` when journals post
- NO database SUM() queries - O(1) query complexity
- Heavy Redis caching (60s TTL for queries, 1800s for reports)
- Multi-tenant safe (all queries tenant-scoped)

**File**: `src/application/services/account-balance.service.ts`

### Trial Balance Generation
**Purpose**: Generate trial balance report with debit/credit verification

**Query**: `GetTrialBalanceQuery` → `GetTrialBalanceHandler`

**Business Rules**:
1. Lists all active accounts with balances
2. Maps to debit/credit columns based on account type:
   - **Debit column**: ASSET, EXPENSE accounts
   - **Credit column**: LIABILITY, EQUITY, REVENUE accounts
3. Verifies: Total Debits === Total Credits (variance < 0.01 BDT tolerance)
4. Groups by account type for financial statement preparation
5. Caches result for 30 minutes (expensive report)

**Files**:
- `src/application/queries/get-trial-balance.query.ts`
- `src/application/queries/handlers/get-trial-balance.handler.ts`
- `src/application/dtos/trial-balance.dto.ts`
- `src/presentation/graphql/types/trial-balance.type.ts`

### Invoice-Payment Linking (Phase 2 Day 7-8)
**Purpose**: Track payments against invoices and auto-transition to PAID status

**Domain Method**: `Invoice.recordPayment(paymentId, paymentAmount)`

**Business Rules**:
1. Can only record payment on APPROVED invoices (not DRAFT or CANCELLED)
2. Cannot overpay invoice (throws `InvoiceOverpaymentException`)
3. Updates `paidAmount` and calculates `remainingAmount`
4. Auto-emits `InvoiceFullyPaidEvent` when `remainingAmount === 0`
5. Invoice status auto-transitions to PAID (event-driven)

**Events Emitted**:
- `InvoicePaymentRecordedEvent` - Payment recorded on invoice
- `InvoiceFullyPaidEvent` - Invoice fully paid (status → PAID)

**Projection Updates**:
- `InvoiceProjection.paidAmount` - Total payments received
- `InvoiceProjection.balanceAmount` - Remaining amount (grandTotal - paidAmount)
- `InvoiceProjection.paidAt` - Timestamp when fully paid
- `InvoiceProjection.status` - Auto-transitions to PAID

**Files**:
- `src/domain/aggregates/invoice/invoice.aggregate.ts:638-681` - recordPayment() method
- `src/domain/aggregates/invoice/events/invoice-payment-recorded.event.ts` - Domain events
- `src/application/queries/handlers/invoice-projection.handler.ts:372-484` - Event handlers

### CompletePaymentHandler - Cross-Aggregate Coordination
**Purpose**: Link completed payments to invoices with graceful degradation

**Workflow**:
1. Complete payment (primary operation)
2. Record payment on linked invoice (secondary operation)
3. If invoice update fails → Payment still completes (graceful degradation)
4. Detailed error logging for manual reconciliation

**Error Handling**:
- **Null Safety**: Checks `invoiceId` exists before calling `.value`
- **Overpayment**: Specific catch for `InvoiceOverpaymentException` with detailed logging
- **Concurrency**: Logs concurrency issues for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation**: Payment completes even if invoice update fails

**File**: `src/application/commands/handlers/complete-payment.handler.ts:70-148`

**Production Considerations**:
- Add reconciliation dashboard to find orphaned payments
- Monitor logs for `InvoiceOverpaymentException` (indicates concurrency issues)
- Set up alerts for failed invoice updates

## Integration Points

### Consumes
- **Authentication Service**: JWT token validation via JwtAuthGuard
- **Organization Service**: Tenant context and schema resolution
- **EventStore DB**: Event persistence and sourcing (port 2113)
- **PostgreSQL**: Read model projections and tenant schemas
- **Kafka**: Event streaming and distributed messaging

### Provides
- `/graphql` - Federated GraphQL schema for financial operations
- `/health/*` - Health check endpoints for monitoring
- **Kafka Events**: Financial domain events for other services
- **EventStore**: Complete audit trail of financial transactions

## Technical Decisions

### Event Sourcing Pattern
- All domain aggregates use event sourcing for complete audit trails
- EventStore DB provides native event storage and streaming
- Read models projected to PostgreSQL for query optimization
- Temporal queries supported for financial reporting

### Multi-Tenancy Architecture
- Schema-based tenant isolation in PostgreSQL
- TenantMiddleware extracts tenant context from requests
- TenantContextService manages tenant-specific configurations
- EventStore streams prefixed with tenant identifiers

### GraphQL Federation
- Apollo Federation v2 for distributed schema composition
- Automatic schema generation from TypeScript decorators
- Federated with other microservices in the ecosystem
- Excludes health endpoints from GraphQL routing

### Simplified Observability
- OpenTelemetry integration with version conflict mitigation
- Custom telemetry module with selective instrumentation
- Health checks include EventStore and database connectivity
- Logging and metrics configured for production monitoring

## Key Patterns

### CQRS with Event Sourcing
- Commands handled by domain aggregates
- Events stored in EventStore DB chronologically
- Read models projected for optimal querying
- Eventual consistency between write and read models

### Domain Events
- Financial transactions generate domain events
- Events published to Kafka for cross-service communication
- Event handlers maintain read model projections
- Saga patterns for distributed transactions

### Multi-Tenant Security
- JWT authentication required for all protected endpoints
- Tenant context isolated at middleware level
- Database schemas separated per tenant
- EventStore streams tenant-scoped
