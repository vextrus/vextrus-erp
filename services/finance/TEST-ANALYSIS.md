## Failures by Category

### 1. Journal Entry Aggregate (CRITICAL - 22 failures)

**Root Cause**: `InvalidAccountingPeriodException` - All journal tests use hardcoded dates (2024-01-15, 2024-07-15) that are now considered "closed accounting periods".

**Location**: `src/domain/aggregates/journal/journal-entry.aggregate.spec.ts`

**Error**:
```
Date 2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z is in a closed accounting period
    at Function.create (domain/aggregates/journal/journal-entry.aggregate.ts:274:13)
```

**Failed Tests** (22):
- should create a journal entry with correct initial state
- should calculate fiscal period correctly for Bangladesh
- should generate correct journal number prefix by type
- should validate balanced journal entries
- should reject unbalanced journal entries
- should require at least two journal lines
- should handle complex multi-line entries
- should reject lines with both debit and credit amounts
- should reject lines with zero amounts
- should accept lines with only debit amount
- should accept lines with only credit amount
- should post a balanced journal entry
- should not allow posting unbalanced entries
- should not allow posting already posted journals
- should create a reversing entry with swapped debits and credits
- should not allow reversing unposted journals
- should reject reversing date in closed period
- should track cost centers in journal lines
- should track tax codes in journal lines
- should auto-post journal if requested and balanced
- should not auto-post unbalanced journal

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Update test fixtures to use dynamic dates (new Date())
2. Or mock the `isAccountingPeriodOpen()` method to return true for tests
3. Verify fiscal period logic doesn't break with current dates

**Severity**: HIGH - Blocks journal entry testing completely

---

### 2. Event Sourcing Version Tracking (4 failures)

**Root Cause**: Aggregate version property not incrementing properly after applying events.

**Location**: Multiple aggregates
- `invoice.aggregate.spec.ts`: "should increment version for each event"
- `payment.aggregate.spec.ts`: "should increment version for each event"
- `chart-of-account.aggregate.spec.ts`: "should increment version for each event"

**Error**:
```typescript
expect(received).toBeGreaterThan(expected)
Expected: > 0
Received:   0
```

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Verify `AggregateRoot` base class increments version on `apply()`
2. Check if version is initialized to 0 in constructor
3. Ensure `apply()` method calls `this.version++` or equivalent

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Version tracking is important for event sourcing but doesn't block core functionality

---

### 3. Payment Aggregate Logic (3 failures)

**Root Cause**: Test logic issues with payment state transitions

**Location**: `src/domain/aggregates/payment/payment.aggregate.spec.ts`

**Failures**:
1. **"should throw error when reversing failed payment"**
   - Error: `Cannot fail payment in COMPLETED status`
   - Issue: Test tries to fail a payment that's already completed
   - Fix: Test should verify reversal of failed payment, not failing a completed payment

2. **"should include tenant ID in all events"**
   - Same error: `Cannot fail payment in COMPLETED status`
   - Fix: Adjust test to use proper state transitions

**Severity**: LOW - Test logic issue, not production code bug

---

### 4. Chart of Account Aggregate (1 failure)

**Location**: `src/domain/aggregates/chart-of-account/chart-of-account.aggregate.spec.ts`

**Failure**: "should include tenant ID in all events"
- Error: `Cannot deactivate account with non-zero balance`
- Issue: Test tries to deactivate an account with balance
- Fix: Set balance to zero before deactivation test

**Severity**: LOW - Test logic issue

---

### 5. Performance Benchmarks (TypeScript Compilation - 8 errors)

**Location**: `src/application/services/__tests__/performance-benchmarks.spec.ts`

**Root Cause**: Interface mismatch with `ExtractedInvoiceData` and Tesseract `Worker` mock

**Errors**:
1. Property 'date' does not exist on type 'ExtractedInvoiceData' (line 108)
2. Property 'customerTin' does not exist (line 112)
3. Property 'musahkCompliant' does not exist (line 118)
4. Property 'loadLanguage' does not exist on type 'Mocked<Worker>' (line 146)
5. Property 'initialize' does not exist, use 'reinitialize' (line 147)
6. Property 'warnings' does not exist (line 215)
7. Property 'customerTin' does not exist (line 237)
8. Property 'validations' does not exist, use 'validation' (line 238)

**Fix Strategy**:
1. Update `ExtractedInvoiceData` interface to match expected properties
2. Fix Tesseract Worker mock to use correct method names
3. Align property names (validations → validation)

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Prevents performance benchmark tests from running

---

### 6. Deployment Preparation Service (2 failures)

**Location**: `src/application/services/__tests__/deployment-preparation.service.spec.ts`

**Failures**:
1. **"should create production documentation"**
   - Error: `expect.stringContaining` mismatch
   - Issue: Documentation file path or content doesn't match expected pattern
   - Fix: Verify file path generation and content structure

2. **"should validate required configuration"**
   - Error: `expect(result).toBe(true)` but `Received: false`
   - Issue: Configuration validation failing in test
   - Fix: Mock all required configuration values

**Severity**: LOW - Service testing issue, not core functionality

---

### 7. Other Service Tests (58+ failures in total)

**Affected Services**:
- ML Model Management (multiple failures)
- Streaming Analytics
- AI Reconciliation
- Analytics Dashboard
- Cash Flow Prediction
- KPI Calculation
- OCR Invoice Processor
- Load Testing
- Migration Service

**Common Patterns**:
- TypeScript interface mismatches
- Mock configuration issues
- External dependency mocking problems (TensorFlow, Tesseract, etc.)

**Severity**: LOW-MEDIUM - These are advanced features, not core finance operations

## Test Execution Time

- **Total Time**: 21.642 seconds
- **Average per Suite**: ~0.83 seconds
- **Performance**: Good (acceptable for CI/CD)

---

## Coverage Goals

**Current** (estimated):
- Lines: 85%+
- Branches: 75%+
- Functions: 80%+
- Statements: 85%+

**Target** (for production):
- Lines: 90%+
- Branches: 85%+
- Functions: 90%+
- Statements: 90%+

**Gap to Close**:
- Fix 90 failing tests
- Add E2E integration tests
- Add missing edge case tests

---

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Today)

1. ✅ **Fix Journal Entry Test Dates** (P0)
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   journalDate: new Date('2024-01-15')

   // After:
   journalDate: new Date() // Current date, always in open period
   // OR
   journalDate: new Date(new Date().getFullYear(), 6, 15) // July 15 of current year
   ```

2. ✅ **Fix Event Sourcing Version** (P1)
   - Verify `AggregateRoot.apply()` implementation
   - Ensure version increments on each event

3. ✅ **Run Tests Again** to verify fixes

### Short-term (This Week)

4. Fix Performance Benchmarks TypeScript errors
5. Fix Payment state transition tests
6. Add E2E integration tests (invoice → payment workflow)

### Medium-term (Next Week)

7. Fix advanced service tests (ML, analytics, OCR)
8. Improve test coverage to 90%+
9. Add stress and load tests

---

## Conclusion

**Overall Assessment**: Good progress, but 90 failing tests need attention.

**Core Functionality**: ✅ Mostly tested (invoice, payment, account commands/queries passing)

**Critical Issues**: 1 blocker (journal entry dates)

**Next Steps**: Fix P0 issues, then proceed with E2E integration tests.

**Target**: 500+ tests passing (from 463) by end of Phase 1.
