## Purpose of This Knowledge Base

The official Claude Code documentation (`sessions/knowledge/claude-code/`) covers the tool itself. This Vextrus ERP knowledge base documents:

1. **How we use plugins** in the context of Vextrus ERP development
2. **Which agents** are best for specific Vextrus tasks
3. **Workflow patterns** proven in 30+ completed tasks
4. **Context optimization** strategies for our 18-microservice architecture
5. **Quality standards** specific to Vextrus ERP

Think of it as the bridge between Claude Code capabilities and Vextrus ERP development practices.

## Compounding Effect

This knowledge base grows with each task completed. When we discover effective patterns, learn new techniques, or optimize workflows, we capture them here for future use.

**Philosophy**: Each unit of engineering work makes subsequent units of work easierâ€”not harder.

**Status**: Initial creation (Phase 2 of workflow upgrade)
**Next**: Populate with comprehensive guides
