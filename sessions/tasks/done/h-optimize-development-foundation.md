## Context Manifest

### How This Currently Works: Vextrus ERP Development Foundation

The Vextrus ERP is built as a comprehensive enterprise resource planning system specifically designed for the Bangladesh construction industry. The current foundation follows a modular monolith architecture with a clear migration path to microservices, implementing Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, and Event Sourcing patterns.

**Current System Architecture:**

The system operates as a monorepo using npm workspaces with three main directories: `services/`, `apps/`, and `shared/`. The `package.json` at the root defines a workspace structure that includes all service modules, applications, and shared components. The build system uses Turbo for orchestrating builds, tests, and deployments across the entire monorepo.

**Infrastructure Layer:**

The development environment is orchestrated through Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`) which provisions a complete infrastructure stack including PostgreSQL 16 for primary data storage, Redis 7 for caching and session management, Apache Kafka for event streaming, and SigNoz for observability. The PostgreSQL instance is initialized with a comprehensive multi-tenant schema (`infrastructure/docker/postgres/init.sql`) that includes core organizations, authentication, and audit logging capabilities with Bengali localization support.

**Service Architecture:**

Currently, only the authentication service is implemented (`services/auth/`) as a NestJS application. This service follows enterprise patterns with dependency injection, CQRS architecture, and comprehensive TypeORM integration. The service configuration (`services/auth/src/config/configuration.ts`) loads environment variables for database connections, Redis caching, JWT token management, Kafka messaging, and bcrypt security settings. The main application bootstrap (`services/auth/src/main.ts`) configures global validation pipes, CORS settings, Swagger documentation, and establishes the API prefix structure.

**Database Design:**

The PostgreSQL schema implements a multi-tenant architecture with row-level security. The initialization script creates three main schemas: `core` for organizational data, `auth` for authentication and authorization, and `audit` for comprehensive audit logging. The schema includes Bengali collation support for proper localization, UUID-based primary keys, automatic audit columns with triggers, and comprehensive indexing for performance. Default roles are seeded with permission-based access control including Super Admin, Organization Admin, Project Manager, Accountant, Engineer, and Viewer roles.

**Frontend Architecture:**

The web application (`apps/web/`) currently contains only a basic entry point (`index.ts`) with plans for Next.js 15 implementation. The architecture documents specify it will use Server Components, App Router, Shadcn/ui components, Zustand for state management, and TanStack Query for data fetching.

**Shared Components:**

The `shared/` directory structure includes kernel domain primitives, contracts for service interfaces, and utilities, though currently only a basic utilities export exists (`shared/utils/index.ts`).

**MCP Integration:**

The system has extensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configuration (`.mcp.json`) including Context7 for documentation research, memory server for knowledge storage, GitHub integration, PostgreSQL server, filesystem access, and various other specialized servers for web scraping, search, and analysis capabilities.

**Development Workflow:**

The project follows a comprehensive development workflow documented in `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` that includes Docker-based development environment setup, database migration management, API testing procedures, and debugging approaches. The workflow supports hot-reload development with the auth service running on port 3001, Swagger documentation, and comprehensive database management through Adminer.

**Architecture Documentation:**

The system is backed by extensive architectural documentation including ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) that justify technology choices, an enterprise architecture document defining microservices patterns, DDD implementation, CQRS with Event Sourcing, and detailed technology stack specifications with Bangladesh-specific integrations for RAJUK and NBR compliance.

### For New Feature Implementation: Foundation Optimization Requirements

Since we're implementing comprehensive foundation optimization, this task will need to integrate with and enhance every aspect of the current system. The optimization will leverage MCP servers extensively for research and knowledge storage, requiring deep integration with the Context7 server for accessing latest documentation and best practices.

**Authentication Service Enhancement:**

The current auth service needs optimization in its TypeScript configuration (currently has relaxed strictness settings), enhanced error handling patterns, implementation of proper domain events, and integration with the broader event sourcing architecture. The service needs comprehensive CQRS command and query handlers, proper aggregate root implementations, and event store integration.

**Infrastructure Optimization:**

The Docker Compose configuration needs optimization for development performance, proper health checks, resource limits, and networking configuration. The PostgreSQL initialization script needs enhancement with proper partitioning strategies, additional indexes for performance, and comprehensive seed data for realistic development scenarios.

**Missing Service Implementation:**

The architecture documents specify six core services (auth, project-management, finance, hr, scm, crm) but only auth is currently implemented. The optimization task needs to establish the foundation patterns that other services will follow, including shared domain models, event contracts, and service communication patterns.

**Frontend Foundation:**

The web application needs complete implementation following the documented Next.js 15 architecture with proper project structure, component organization, API client setup, and state management patterns.

**Testing Framework:**

There's no current testing infrastructure in place. The optimization needs to establish comprehensive testing patterns including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests using Playwright (configured in MCP), and load testing procedures.

**Documentation System:**

Each service needs proper CLAUDE.md files for context and documentation. The current system lacks comprehensive developer documentation, API documentation beyond Swagger, and operational runbooks.

**Monitoring and Observability:**

The SigNoz configuration needs completion, proper metrics collection, distributed tracing setup, and business KPI monitoring. The optimization needs to establish comprehensive logging patterns, error tracking, and performance monitoring across all services.
