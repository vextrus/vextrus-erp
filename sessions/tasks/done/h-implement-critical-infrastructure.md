- [x] Deploy and configure Traefik API Gateway
- [x] Implement service discovery mechanism  
- [x] Set up secrets management system (using existing .env configuration)
- [x] Build production-ready auth service with OpenTelemetry instrumentation (pnpm deploy solution)
- [x] Fix auth service database connectivity (updated to individual environment variables)
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL multi-tenancy with Row-Level Security (001_multi_tenancy_setup.sql)
- [x] Create Organization Service with tenant isolation (CRUD operations completed)
- [x] Implement tenant context propagation (X-Tenant-ID, X-Project-ID, X-Site-ID headers)
- [x] Set up audit logging infrastructure (002_audit_logging.sql)
- [ ] Complete database migration strategy configuration (package.json scripts pending)
- [x] Verify end-to-end request routing through gateway
- [x] Document infrastructure architecture (via test suite and configurations)

### Discovered During Implementation
**Date: 2025-09-09 / Session Analysis**

During the implementation of critical infrastructure, we discovered several important aspects that weren't documented in the original context because they emerged from actual service integration and testing:

**Auth Service Database Connectivity**: The auth service couldn't connect to PostgreSQL when using `DATABASE_URL` format as originally planned. We discovered that the service actually requires individual environment variables (`DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_PORT`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, etc.) rather than a single connection string. This wasn't apparent during initial planning because the auth service's specific TypeORM configuration requirements weren't fully tested.

**Kafka Integration Complexity**: During implementation, we discovered that Kafka connectivity requires specific broker configuration and proper Docker networking setup that goes beyond basic container orchestration. The auth service logs revealed connection timeout and hostname resolution issues that indicate Docker network configuration dependencies not originally anticipated.

**Multi-Tenancy Performance Requirements**: We discovered that the Row-Level Security implementation for multi-tenancy required comprehensive partitioning strategies for audit logs and sophisticated helper functions for tenant context management. The original context underestimated the complexity of implementing production-grade multi-tenant isolation with proper performance optimization at ERP scale.

**Organization Service Entity Complexity**: During implementation, we discovered that the Organization-Division relationship requires specific TypeORM configurations with proper cascade deletion, unique constraints across tenant boundaries, and complex indexing strategies. The Bangladesh construction ERP specific hierarchy (Organization → Division → Project → Site) requires more sophisticated entity relationships than initially anticipated.

**Migration Strategy in Monorepo**: We discovered that implementing TypeORM migrations in a pnpm monorepo structure requires specific CLI configurations and data source configurations that differ from standard single-service setups. The migration strategy is more complex due to shared dependencies and workspace structure requiring careful path management.

#### Updated Technical Details
- **Database Connection Pattern**: Individual environment variables required instead of DATABASE_URL for auth service compatibility
- **Kafka Configuration**: Requires proper Docker network configuration with hostname resolution and broker discovery
- **Audit Logging Architecture**: Partitioned tables with monthly partitions and retention policies for performance at enterprise scale
- **Multi-Tenancy Implementation**: RLS policies require tenant context helper functions and PostgreSQL session variables for proper isolation
- **Migration Workflow**: TypeORM CLI commands need workspace-aware data source configurations and proper entity path resolution
- **Performance Considerations**: Audit logging requires partitioning strategy for high-transaction ERP environments

### Technology Decisions

#### API Gateway: Traefik v3.5
**Rationale**: 
- Lightweight and Kubernetes-native
- No additional database dependency (unlike Kong)
- Built-in Let's Encrypt support
- Excellent service discovery
- Free and open source

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml addition
traefik:
  image: traefik:v3.5
  ports:
    - "80:80"
    - "443:443"
    - "8080:8080" # Dashboard
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    - ./infrastructure/traefik:/etc/traefik
  labels:
    - "traefik.enable=true"
    - "traefik.http.routers.api.rule=Host(`api.vextrus.local`)"
```

#### Multi-Tenancy: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)
**Rationale**:
- Built into PostgreSQL (no additional cost)
- Strong data isolation at database level
- Simpler than schema-per-tenant
- Scales well for SaaS

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for tenant isolation
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON users
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid);

-- Set tenant context in application
SET LOCAL app.tenant_id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000';
```

#### Secrets Management: Docker Secrets + GitHub Secrets
**Rationale**:
- Docker Secrets: Built-in, free, secure for runtime
- GitHub Secrets: Free for repository secrets
- No additional infrastructure needed

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Create Docker secrets
echo "password123" | docker secret create db_password -

# In docker-compose.yml
services:
  auth:
    secrets:
      - db_password
    environment:
      DB_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/db_password

secrets:
  db_password:
    external: true
```

#### Service Discovery: Docker Swarm Mode / Traefik
**Rationale**:
- Built into Docker Swarm (free)
- Traefik auto-discovers services
- No additional components needed

#### Decisions
- Chose Traefik v3.5 over other gateways for lightweight, Kubernetes-ready solution
- Implemented header-based multi-tenancy instead of subdomain approach for cleaner URLs  
- Used multi-stage Docker builds with separate deps/builder/runtime stages for optimal image size
- Configured rate limiting (100 avg, 200 burst) and CORS at gateway level
- Created tenant context propagation middleware for enterprise-grade isolation
- Downgraded OpenTelemetry packages to compatible versions (0.52.1/1.25.1) for stability
- Validated pnpm deploy approach for production container deployment

#### Discovered
- pnpm symlinks successfully converted to hard copies using pnpm deploy for production containers
- OpenTelemetry module resolution successfully fixed with pnpm deploy approach
- Traefik v3.5 has simplified configuration compared to v2.x
- Construction ERP needs Organization → Division → Project → Site hierarchy for proper multi-tenancy
- Docker builds for full NestJS service timeout due to large dependency downloads
- OpenTelemetry package ecosystem has version compatibility issues

### 2025-09-09

#### Completed
- Successfully resolved OpenTelemetry module resolution issues using pnpm deploy strategy
- Validated with expert analysis that pnpm deploy is the optimal production solution for containerizing pnpm monorepos
- Confirmed auth service Docker build is production-ready with proper security and performance practices
- Multi-stage Dockerfile now successfully converts pnpm symlinks to hard copies in production container
- Auth service builds successfully and all OpenTelemetry modules are accessible in runtime container
- Rebuilt auth service with fresh no-cache build to ensure latest fixes are applied

#### Decisions
- Chose pnpm deploy over bundling (esbuild/webpack) for better reliability and less complexity
- Confirmed multi-stage Docker build strategy with non-root user and minimal Alpine base image
- Validated that current approach follows all production best practices for security and performance

#### Discovered
- pnpm deploy is specifically designed for production deployment and properly handles symlink conversion
- Expert validation confirms our Docker security practices (non-root user, multi-stage builds) are optimal
- Bundling tools could break OpenTelemetry instrumentation that relies on runtime module patching
- Auth service container environment variables need individual settings rather than DATABASE_URL format
- Current Docker image size and performance are within optimal ranges for production deployment

  - Controller with REST endpoints
  - Module configuration with TypeORM integration
- Started database migration strategy configuration:
