# Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification

## Objective
Verify all underlying infrastructure is properly configured and operational before testing application code.

## Checklist

### Database Setup
- [ ] PostgreSQL is running and accessible
- [ ] Connection string in .env is correct
- [ ] Database migrations are up-to-date
- [ ] Seed data is properly loaded
- [ ] MCP PostgreSQL server connects successfully
- [ ] Test queries return expected data

### MCP Server Configuration
- [ ] Verify .mcp.json has all required servers
- [ ] PostgreSQL MCP server is functional
- [ ] SQLite MCP server is functional
- [ ] Prisma MCP servers (local and remote) are configured

## Test Commands
```bash
# Database verification
npm run db:status
npm run db:seed:check

# MCP verification
mcp list-servers
mcp test-connection postgres
mcp test-connection prisma-local

# Build verification
npm run type-check
npm run build
npm run dev
```

## Expected Results
- All database tables exist with correct schema
- Seed data includes at least 50 test tasks
- MCP servers respond within 2 seconds
- Build completes without errors
- Dev server starts on port 3000
