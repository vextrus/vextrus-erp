# Comprehensive Testing & Verification of Enterprise Task Grid Implementation

## Problem/Goal
Previous session claimed to have implemented a complete enterprise task grid with service integrations. This session will systematically test, debug, and verify all implementations to ensure they actually work as claimed. We need to prove that the 40+ column grid, service adapters, and all integrations are functional.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Database is running with proper seed data
- [ ] MCP servers (PostgreSQL, SQLite, Prisma) are properly configured and accessible
- [ ] All service adapters (CPM, WBS, Weather, Resource) execute without errors
- [ ] TaskPanelEnhanced renders without build errors
- [ ] Service data properly enriches task display in grid
- [ ] Custom cell renderers display correctly
- [ ] Theme system works in both light/dark modes
- [ ] Playwright E2E tests pass for grid interactions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet acceptable thresholds
- [ ] All TypeScript errors are resolved
- [ ] Integration between services and grid is seamless

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification
- Database connectivity and seed data
- MCP server configurations
- Environment variables
- Build system health

### Phase 2: Service Layer Testing
- Individual service adapter unit tests
- Service registry integration
- Mock data vs real data verification
- Error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Component Testing
- TaskPanelEnhanced rendering
- Custom cell renderers
- Theme system
- Event handlers

### Phase 4: Integration Testing
- End-to-end data flow from services to UI
- Real-time updates
- Performance under load
- Browser compatibility

### Phase 5: Bug Fixes & Optimization
- Address all discovered issues
- Performance optimization
- Code cleanup
- Documentation updates

## Testing Tools & Resources
- **Playwright MCP** - Browser automation and E2E testing
- **Serena MCP** - Code analysis and debugging
- **PostgreSQL MCP** - Database verification
- **SQLite MCP** - Local database testing
- **Prisma MCP** - Schema and migration validation
- **Console MCP** - Performance monitoring
- **Brave Search MCP** - Latest testing best practices

## User Notes
- User expressed skepticism about implementation claims
- Requires concrete proof that all features work
- Emphasis on systematic, thorough testing
- Use MCP servers intelligently for efficiency
- Leverage specialized agents for heavy lifting

## Test Scenarios

### Database Tests
1. Verify PostgreSQL connection
2. Check seed data integrity
3. Test CRUD operations on tasks
4. Validate relationships and constraints

### Service Tests
1. CPM calculations with sample project data
2. WBS hierarchy generation
3. Weather impact for Bangladesh location
4. Resource leveling with conflicts
5. Service caching and performance

### UI Tests
1. Grid loads with 100+ tasks
2. Inline editing saves correctly
3. Sorting and filtering work
4. Export to CSV/Excel functions
5. Custom renderers display properly
6. Dark mode toggle
7. Responsive design

### Integration Tests
1. Create task → Service calculation → UI update flow
2. Bulk operations performance
3. Real-time sync between grid and Gantt
4. Error recovery and fallbacks
