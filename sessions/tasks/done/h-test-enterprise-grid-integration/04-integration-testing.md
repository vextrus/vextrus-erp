# Phase 4: Integration Testing

## Objective
Test the complete data flow from database through services to UI, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

## End-to-End Data Flow

### Create Task Flow
- [ ] User creates task in UI
- [ ] Task saves to database
- [ ] Services recalculate (CPM, WBS)
- [ ] UI updates with new data
- [ ] Other components receive events
- [ ] Gantt chart syncs

### Update Task Flow
- [ ] Inline edit in grid
- [ ] Validation passes
- [ ] Database update succeeds
- [ ] Service data refreshes
- [ ] Related tasks update
- [ ] Dependencies recalculate

### Delete Task Flow
- [ ] User selects tasks
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Database deletion succeeds
- [ ] Services adjust calculations
- [ ] UI removes rows
- [ ] Orphaned dependencies handled

## Service Integration Tests

### Task + CPM Integration
- [ ] Task dates affect critical path
- [ ] Dependencies drive calculations
- [ ] Slack updates when dates change
- [ ] Critical path highlights update
- [ ] Project completion recalculates

### Task + WBS Integration
- [ ] Parent tasks roll up hours
- [ ] WBS codes regenerate correctly
- [ ] Hierarchy changes cascade
- [ ] Work packages identified
- [ ] Level calculations accurate

### Task + Weather Integration
- [ ] Task dates check weather windows
- [ ] Location affects calculations
- [ ] Monsoon periods identified
- [ ] Productivity adjustments apply
- [ ] Delay recommendations shown

### Task + Resource Integration
- [ ] Resource assignments create conflicts
- [ ] Leveling adjusts task dates
- [ ] Utilization charts update
- [ ] Cost calculations cascade
- [ ] Overallocation warnings appear

## Real-Time Synchronization

### Grid â†” Gantt Sync
- [ ] Task updates reflect immediately
- [ ] Drag operations sync both ways
- [ ] Progress updates sync
- [ ] Selection syncs
- [ ] Zoom/scroll coordination

### Multi-User Scenarios
- [ ] Optimistic updates work
- [ ] Conflict resolution handles races
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Presence indicators work
- [ ] Collaborative editing safe

## Performance Under Load

### Stress Tests
- [ ] 100 concurrent task updates
- [ ] 1000 tasks in grid
- [ ] 50 resources with conflicts
- [ ] Full year weather calculations
- [ ] Complex dependency chains

### Memory Management
- [ ] No memory leaks after 1 hour
- [ ] Service caches bounded
- [ ] DOM nodes properly cleaned
- [ ] Event listeners removed
- [ ] WebSocket connections managed

## Error Recovery

### Network Failures
- [ ] Offline mode queues changes
- [ ] Retry logic works
- [ ] User notified of issues
- [ ] Recovery is graceful
- [ ] No data loss occurs

### Service Failures
- [ ] Individual service failure isolated
- [ ] Fallback data used
- [ ] User can continue working
- [ ] Errors logged properly
- [ ] Recovery automatic when possible

## Data Consistency

### Transaction Tests
- [ ] Multi-table updates atomic
- [ ] Rollback on partial failure
- [ ] Constraints enforced
- [ ] Referential integrity maintained
- [ ] Audit trail complete

### Cache Coherency
- [ ] Service caches stay synchronized
- [ ] Browser cache invalidation works
- [ ] Stale data detected
- [ ] Refresh mechanisms work
- [ ] TTLs respected

## Security Tests

### Authorization
- [ ] Role-based access enforced
- [ ] Project isolation works
- [ ] API endpoints secured
- [ ] CSRF protection active
- [ ] XSS prevention working

### Data Validation
- [ ] Input sanitization complete
- [ ] SQL injection prevented
- [ ] Type validation enforced
- [ ] Business rules checked
- [ ] Error messages safe
