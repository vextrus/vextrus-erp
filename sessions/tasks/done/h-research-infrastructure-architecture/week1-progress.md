# Week 1 Critical Fixes - Progress Report
Date: 2025-09-13
Status: Day 1 Complete

## Completed Today

### ‚úÖ Temporal Deployment (CRITICAL BLOCKER RESOLVED)
- Successfully deployed Temporal server and UI containers
- Temporal server running on port 7233
- Temporal UI accessible at http://localhost:8088
- Workflow service configuration updated with correct credentials
- Workflow service now starts successfully and connects to Temporal

### ‚úÖ Configuration Standardization
Created comprehensive configuration structure:
1. **Root configuration** (`.env.development`):
   - Standardized database credentials (vextrus/vextrus_dev_2024)
   - Unified service ports and URLs
   - Bangladesh-specific defaults (BDT, Asia/Dhaka, VAT 15%)
   - Development tool settings

2. **Service-specific .env files**:
   - `services/auth/.env` - Updated database name to vextrus_dev
   - `services/workflow/.env` - Temporal configuration included
   - `services/master-data/.env` - GraphQL settings configured
   - `services/rules-engine/.env` - Business rules defaults

3. **Validation Script** (`scripts/validate-infrastructure.sh`):
   - Comprehensive health checking for all components
   - Port availability verification
   - Service status monitoring
   - Color-coded output for quick status assessment

## Current Infrastructure Status

### Working Components
‚úÖ PostgreSQL (port 5432) - Database ready
‚úÖ Redis (port 6379) - Cache operational
‚úÖ Kafka (port 9092) - Message broker running
‚úÖ Zookeeper (port 2181) - Kafka coordinator
‚úÖ Temporal (port 7233) - Workflow engine active
‚úÖ Temporal UI (port 8088) - Management interface
‚úÖ MinIO (ports 9000-9001) - Object storage

### Services Status
‚ö†Ô∏è Auth Service - Starting (configuration updated)
‚ö†Ô∏è Workflow Service - Connected to Temporal
‚ö†Ô∏è Master Data - Needs GraphQL schema fix
‚ö†Ô∏è Rules Engine - Configuration ready
üî¥ API Gateway - Blocked on GraphQL vs REST decision

## Tomorrow's Priority: API Gateway Resolution

### Option A: Add GraphQL to Services (Recommended)
**Why this approach:**
- Keeps federation benefits
- Progressive migration path
- Better for long-term scalability

**Implementation tasks:**
1. Add basic GraphQL schema to auth service
2. Add GraphQL schema to workflow service
3. Add GraphQL schema to rules-engine
4. Update API Gateway federation config
5. Test federated queries

### Option B: Switch to REST Aggregation
**Why consider:**
- Simpler immediate solution
- Team more familiar with REST
- Faster initial implementation

**Implementation tasks:**
1. Replace Apollo Federation with express-gateway
2. Implement REST composition patterns
3. Add request routing logic
4. Create API documentation

## Commands to Run Services

```bash
# Start all infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# Verify infrastructure
bash scripts/validate-infrastructure.sh

# Start services (in separate terminals)
cd services/auth && npm run start:dev
cd services/workflow && npm run start:dev
cd services/master-data && npm run start:dev
cd services/rules-engine && npm run start:dev

# Check Temporal UI
open http://localhost:8088

# Test service health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health
curl http://localhost:3010/health
```

## Key Discoveries
1. Temporal requires explicit namespace configuration
2. All services must use 'vextrus' database user, not 'postgres'
3. Workflow service successfully connects to Temporal with proper config
4. Services can start independently with correct .env files

## Blockers Resolved
‚úÖ Temporal deployment - Now running and accessible
‚úÖ Database credentials - Standardized across all services
‚úÖ Service configurations - .env files created

## Remaining Blockers
üî¥ API Gateway architecture mismatch (GraphQL vs REST)
‚ö†Ô∏è Master-data GraphQL schema generation issues
‚ö†Ô∏è Inter-service communication patterns not established

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Temporal deployment | ‚úÖ RESOLVED | Successfully deployed |
| Configuration drift | ‚úÖ MITIGATED | Standardized .env files |
| Service dependencies | ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS | Health checks implemented |
| GraphQL complexity | üî¥ PENDING | Decision needed tomorrow |

## Tomorrow's Plan (Day 2)

### Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
1. Make GraphQL vs REST decision
2. Begin implementing chosen approach
3. Create first service schema/endpoint

### Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
1. Complete API Gateway integration
2. Test service-to-service communication
3. Implement remaining health checks
4. Document API patterns

### End of Day Goals
- API Gateway serving requests
- At least 2 services integrated
- Basic monitoring dashboard
- Updated documentation

## Notes
- Temporal deployment was easier than expected
- Configuration standardization will prevent future issues
- GraphQL decision is critical for tomorrow
- Team should review federation vs REST tonight

*Day 1 successfully unblocked the critical Temporal dependency and standardized configurations. Ready for API Gateway resolution tomorrow.*
