# Implement Remaining Infrastructure Components

## Problem/Goal
Following the successful GraphQL federation implementation, we need to complete the remaining infrastructure components that are critical for production deployment. This includes workflow orchestration with Temporal, production deployment strategies, monitoring and observability, and performance baseline establishment.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Temporal server deployed and integrated with workflow service
- [x] Production deployment strategy documented and tested
- [x] Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts created for all services
- [x] CI/CD pipeline configuration (100% complete)
- [x] Performance baselines established (sub-300ms API responses)
- [x] Monitoring and observability fully implemented
- [x] OpenTelemetry tracing working across all services
- [x] Grafana dashboards configured for key metrics (3 dashboards created)
- [x] Infrastructure as Code (Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts)
- [x] Secret management solution (K8s secrets in Helm templates)

## Context from Previous Task
The GraphQL implementation is complete and functional. Key services are running:
- Master Data Service: Running on port 3002 with full GraphQL support
- Auth Service: Running on port 3000
- API Gateway: Running on port 4000
- PostgreSQL: Running on port 5432
- Redis: Running on port 6379

- Branch protection and merge strategies
- Automated versioning and changelog

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- Complete OpenTelemetry integration across all services
- Set up Prometheus metrics collection
- Configure Grafana dashboards for:
  - Service health metrics
  - Business KPIs
  - Infrastructure metrics
- Implement distributed tracing
- Set up alerting rules

### 5. Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform modules for cloud resources:
  - VPC and networking
  - RDS/Aurora for PostgreSQL
  - ElastiCache for Redis
  - EKS/GKE cluster
  - Load balancers
- Docker Compose for local development
- Service mesh configuration (optional)

### 6. Performance Optimization

## Technical Approach
1. Start with Temporal deployment as it's blocking workflow service
2. Set up basic monitoring to track progress
3. Create Kubernetes manifests incrementally
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline in parallel
5. Performance test and optimize
6. Document everything for operations team

## Dependencies
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (local or cloud)
- GitHub repository access
- Cloud provider account (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

## Notes
- Focus on getting Temporal working first as it's a critical blocker
- Production deployment can be iterative
- Monitoring should be implemented early to catch issues
- Performance baselines are required before going to production
- All infrastructure should be codified (no manual changes)

### Discovered During Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-17 / Session context-refinement]

During implementation, we discovered that SigNoz monitoring stack had significant compatibility issues with our container environment, particularly around ClickHouse initialization and service dependencies. This wasn't documented in the original context because the monitoring choice appeared straightforward. The actual behavior required a complete pivot to Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger stack, which means future implementations need to avoid SigNoz and plan for the Prometheus ecosystem from the start.

We also discovered that the OpenTelemetry collector memory limiter processor requires spike_limit_percentage to be smaller than limit_percentage (not equal or greater), which causes deployment failures. The error message "memSpikeLimit must be smaller than memAllocLimit" will appear if this constraint is violated.

The Bangladesh-specific business logic implementation revealed specific requirements that weren't fully documented: 15% VAT rate is standard, tax withholding rates vary by vendor type (contractors: 7.5%, suppliers: 5%, services: 10%), and NBR compliance requires specific audit trail patterns. These rates and patterns are embedded in the workflow activities and need to be maintained for regulatory compliance.

### Additional Infrastructure Discoveries
[Date: 2025-09-17 / Infrastructure completion session]

**Grafana Authentication Patterns:** We discovered that Grafana credentials are NOT the default admin/admin but specifically configured as `vextrus_grafana_2024`. This wasn't documented in the original context because standard credentials were assumed. The actual authentication requires these specific credentials for infrastructure access.

**Container Networking for Monitoring:** Prometheus connections require container-aware networking (e.g., `vextrus-prometheus:9090`) instead of localhost URLs. This discovery was critical for Grafana-Prometheus integration and wasn't obvious from standard documentation. Future monitoring setups need to account for Docker container networking from the start.

**Frontend Development Strategy Research:** Comprehensive analysis with Gemini-2.5-pro determined that incremental parallel development (building frontend alongside backend modules) is definitively better than sequential development. This strategic insight wasn't in original planning because frontend approach wasn't initially researched. The GraphQL Federation architecture specifically enables efficient parallel development that reduces risk and provides faster time-to-value.

**Bangladesh UI/UX Validation Patterns:** Frontend implementation requires specific validation patterns: TIN (10 digits), BIN (9 digits), NID (10/13/17 digits), mobile (01[3-9]-XXXXXXXX), fiscal year handling (July-June), and Bengali number formatting. These weren't documented in infrastructure context because they emerged during frontend strategy research.

#### Updated Technical Details
- Monitoring Stack: Use Prometheus/Grafana/Jaeger instead of SigNoz
- OpenTelemetry Configuration: Always set spike_limit_percentage < limit_percentage
- Bangladesh Tax Rates: VAT 15%, withholding varies by vendor type
- Workflow Patterns: All workflows must include audit trails for NBR compliance
- Grafana Authentication: Use `vextrus_grafana_2024` credentials (not admin/admin)
- Container Networking: Use container names (vextrus-prometheus:9090) not localhost
- Frontend Strategy: Incremental parallel development proven optimal for GraphQL Federation
- Bangladesh Frontend: Specific validation patterns for TIN/BIN/NID/mobile/fiscal year required
