# Task: Vextrus ERP Migration - From Legacy to Enterprise

## Priority
MEDIUM - Strategic migration to new architecture

## Context
After extensive research on enterprise ERP systems (SAP S/4HANA, Oracle Cloud ERP, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Primavera P6, Procore), the decision has been made to migrate from the current vextrus-app to a new vextrus-erp project with modern enterprise architecture.

## Background
- Current system (vextrus-app) has become over-engineered with poor UX
- TanStack Table integration attempted but rejected due to quality issues
- Complete Project Module UI removed for fresh start
- Comprehensive research completed on enterprise PM systems
- Architecture documents created: PROJECT_MODULE_V3_FINAL.md, IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY_FINAL.md

## Success Criteria
1. [ ] Claude Code infrastructure migrated to vextrus-erp
2. [ ] Project structure initialized with modern architecture
3. [ ] Core documentation created (architecture, modules, development guide)
4. [ ] Development environment configured
5. [ ] First service (authentication) scaffolded
6. [ ] CI/CD pipeline established

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Migration
- Migrate .claude/ directory with state management
- Transfer sessions/ with tasks and protocols
- Configure MCP servers for new project
- Update hooks for enterprise patterns

### Phase 2: Project Foundation
- Initialize monorepo structure (Turbo)
- Setup microservices architecture
- Configure DDD structure (domain, application, infrastructure)
- Establish shared kernel and contracts

### Phase 3: Documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Module specifications
- API documentation
- Development guidelines
- Bangladesh localization requirements

### Phase 4: Core Services
- Authentication & Authorization
- Organization Management
- System Administration
- API Gateway

### Phase 5: Business Modules
- Project Management (Primavera-level CPM)
- Finance & Accounting (Bangladesh tax compliance)
- Human Resources (local labor law)
- Supply Chain Management
- CRM & Sales

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js 20/Bun, NestJS, TypeScript
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, PWA, Electron
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (OLTP), ClickHouse (OLAP), Redis
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka
- **Architecture**: Microservices, DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing

## Bangladesh Optimizations
- RAJUK integration
- NBR tax compliance (VAT, AIT)
- bKash/Nagad payment gateways
- Bengali language support
- District-based operations
- Monsoon impact calculations
