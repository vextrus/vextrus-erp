#### Phase 2: Parallel Workflow Analysis (100% Complete)

**Agent 1 - .claude/ Directory Analysis** ✅

**Key Findings**:
- **Quality Gap**: Core Skills avg 170 lines vs Advanced Skills avg 485 lines (65% shorter)
- **Resource Gap**: Core Skills 0.67 avg vs Advanced Skills 3.0 avg (78% fewer)
- **Integration Gap**: Core Skills 0% have auto_load_knowledge, Advanced Skills 100%
- **Frontmatter Gap**: Core Skills missing version, triggers array in frontmatter

**What Makes Advanced Skills Better** (8 patterns identified):
1. Frontmatter completeness (version, triggers array, auto_load_knowledge)
2. 500+ lines with 7+ patterns each (vs 1-2 patterns in Core)
3. Code-heavy with production-ready examples
4. Evidence-based (codebase references, metrics)
5. Quality checklists + anti-patterns
6. Decision trees + reference tables
7. Knowledge base auto-loading
8. 3 resource files per skill

**Agent 2 - sessions/ Directory Analysis** ✅

**Knowledge Base Status**:
- 14 pattern files exist in `sessions/knowledge/vextrus-erp/patterns/`

- Created Task Type → Skills Activation Matrix (10 task types)

**Cross-Skill Dependencies**:
- 6 primary dependency chains documented
- 11 high-synergy skill pairs identified
- 45+ cross-references in SKILL.md files
