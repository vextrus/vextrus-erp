# Week 4: Full Production Deployment

## Goal
Implement event sourcing snapshots and scale to 100% of users with complete production monitoring and incident response readiness.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Implement snapshot strategy for all 4 aggregates
- [ ] Scale to 100% of users (100 concurrent)
- [ ] Load test: 100 concurrent users, P95 <300ms
- [ ] Production monitoring dashboards live
- [ ] Runbook and incident response procedures ready
- [ ] 72-hour stability: error rate <0.5%, 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Backend production deployment COMPLETE

## Key Tasks

### 1. Event Sourcing Snapshots (8 hours)
**Files**:
- `invoice-event-store.repository.ts`
- `payment-event-store.repository.ts`
- `journal-entry-event-store.repository.ts`
- `chart-of-account-event-store.repository.ts`

**Implementation**:
- Snapshot every 50 events
- Store in separate EventStore streams
- Load latest snapshot + new events on aggregate rehydration

**Expected Impact**: 4-5x faster aggregate loading (200ms → 50ms for large aggregates)

### 2. Final Load Testing
```bash
k6 run --vus 100 --duration 10m load-test-finance.js
```

**Target Metrics**:
- 100 concurrent users
- P95 latency: <300ms
- P99 latency: <500ms
- Error rate: <0.5%
- Cache hit rate: >70%

### 3. Production Monitoring
- Grafana dashboards for all KPIs
- SigNoz distributed tracing
- PagerDuty alerting integration
- Runbook documentation complete

### 4. Full Deployment (100%)
```bash
# Deploy to 100% traffic
kubectl apply -f k8s/finance-service-production.yaml

# Verify full deployment
kubectl get deployments
kubectl logs -f deployment/finance-service

# Monitor for 72 hours
```

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Load test: 100 users, P95 <300ms ✅
- [ ] Snapshots functional ✅
- [ ] 100% deployment successful ✅
- [ ] 72-hour stability confirmed ✅
- [ ] Production certification COMPLETE ✅

## Phased Rollout COMPLETE

**Final Status**: Finance service successfully deployed to 100% of users

**Metrics Achieved**:
- ✅ 0 critical/high security vulnerabilities
- ✅ 100 concurrent user capacity
- ✅ P95 response time <300ms
- ✅ Error rate <0.5%
- ✅ 99.9% uptime
