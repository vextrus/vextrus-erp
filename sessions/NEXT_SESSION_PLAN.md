# Next Session: World-Class Task Management Panel

## Session Goal
Build a **world-class open-source task management panel** that rivals MS Project, Primavera P6, and Monday.com, specifically optimized for civil engineering projects in Bangladesh.

## Key Decisions from Previous Sessions
1. **NO AG-Grid** - No enterprise license available
2. **Selected TanStack Table v8** - Headless UI with unlimited customization potential
3. **Architecture Decision**: Modular VextrusTable wrapper with specialized components
4. **Performance Strategy**: Virtual scrolling with memoization for 10,000+ row support
5. **Bangladesh Focus**: Localization with Bengali support, BDT currency, monsoon risk indicators

4. Keep main thread light

### During Development
- Use `context-gathering` agent for initial analysis
- Offload file operations to specialized agents
- Regular context compaction at 75% usage
- Use `logging` agent for progress tracking

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Load 10,000 tasks in < 2 seconds
- [ ] Support 5-level WBS hierarchy
- [ ] Real-time collaboration for 20+ users
- [ ] Offline mode with sync
- [ ] Export to MS Project/Primavera formats
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Mobile app performance

## Bangladesh Market Differentiators
1. **Monsoon Planning** - ML-based delay predictions
2. **RAJUK Integration** - Direct API submission
3. **Local Vendor DB** - Verified supplier network
4. **Safety Compliance** - BNBC checklist automation
5. **Progress Photos** - AI verification against schedule
6. **Bengali UI** - Full localization

## Work Log

### 2025-09-04

#### Completed
- Researched open-source grid libraries and selected TanStack Table v8 as optimal choice
- Created comprehensive implementation plan saved in docs/tanstack-table-implementation-plan.md
- Analyzed existing UI/UX patterns and designed deep customization strategy
- Designed hierarchical WBS implementation for construction projects
- Planned performance optimization with virtual scrolling for 10,000+ rows
- Designed CRUD operations and service integration patterns
- Planned Bangladesh-specific features (Bengali language, BDT currency, monsoon indicators)
- Created 6-week migration roadmap with weekly milestones
- Fixed comprehensive Windows encoding issues in all Python hook files
- Resolved UnicodeDecodeError and UnicodeEncodeError issues across cc-sessions system
- Added UTF-8 encoding parameters to all file open operations in hooks
- Fixed JSON output encoding to handle Unicode characters (emojis, Bengali text)

#### Decisions
- Chose TanStack Table v8 over alternatives (Glide Data Grid, MUI X, Handsontable) for headless flexibility and performance
- Designed modular architecture with VextrusTable wrapper component
- Established performance targets: <200ms initial render, 60fps scrolling, <2s load for 10k rows
- Selected construction-themed color scheme with safety orange accents
- Planned adaptive layouts: Desktop (full table), Tablet (essential columns), Mobile (card view)
- Standardized UTF-8 encoding across all hook file operations for Windows compatibility

#### Discovered
- TanStack Table provides perfect headless architecture for deep customization
- Virtual scrolling essential for handling 10,000+ construction tasks
- Need specialized WBS data structure with aggregated progress/cost calculations
- Importance of theme integration with existing construction-themed design system
- Windows cp1252 encoding conflicts with Unicode characters in hook files
- Python hooks need explicit encoding='utf-8' parameter on all file operations
- JSON outputs need ensure_ascii=False for proper Unicode character handling

#### Next Steps
- Begin Phase 1: Create VextrusTable core component and theme integration
- Implement basic column definitions for task properties
- Set up status, priority, and progress cell renderers
- Test initial performance with mock data

#### Hook Files Fixed
- `task-transcript-link.py`: Fixed lines 28, 98, 108 for UTF-8 file operations
- `user-messages.py`: Fixed lines 27, 53, 191 for UTF-8 and JSON encoding
- `sessions-enforce.py`: Fixed line 51 for UTF-8 file reading
- `session-start.py`: Fixed lines 17, 65, 85, 98, 137, 191 for UTF-8 operations
- `shared_state.py`: Fixed all file operations (lines 37, 49, 63, 71, 89, 97, 111, 121)

## Next Session Checklist

  modules: {
    wbs: WBSModule          // Hierarchical structure
    gantt: GanttModule      // Timeline view
    resources: ResourceModule // Allocation matrix
    weather: WeatherModule  // Impact analysis
    rajuk: RAJUKModule      // Approval tracking
    evm: EVMModule          // Earned value
    risk: RiskModule        // Risk register
  }
  adapters: {
    msproject: MSProjectAdapter
    primavera: PrimaveraAdapter
    excel: ExcelAdapter
  }
}
```

## Competitive Analysis Focus
