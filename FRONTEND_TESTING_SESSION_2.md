# Frontend Testing Session 2 - Summary

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Objective**: Complete E2E Playwright testing for Finance module integration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auth Service GraphQL Mutation Fix ✅
- **Issue**: GraphQL mutations failing due to missing GraphQL execution context
- **Fix**: Added `@nestjs/graphql` execution context interceptor to auth service
- **Location**: `services/auth/src/infrastructure/interceptors/graphql-execution-context.interceptor.ts`
- **Result**: Login mutations now work correctly

### 2. Alert Component Variant Error ✅
- **Issue**: Invoice page using `variant="destructive"` not supported by Alert component
- **Fix**: Changed to `variant="error"` in invoice page
- **Location**: `apps/web/src/app/finance/invoices/page.tsx:94`
- **Result**: No more component rendering errors

### 3. API Gateway CORS Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: CORS blocking requests from localhost:3000
- **Fix**: Updated CORS origin to include `['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:4000']`
- **Location**: `services/api-gateway/src/main.ts:21`
- **Verification**: Curl tests confirm CORS headers are correct
- **Result**: Server-side CORS working (client-side issues remain)

## Test Scenarios Completed

### ✅ Scenario 1: Dashboard Access
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Screenshot**: `.playwright-mcp/dashboard-working.png`
- **Details**: Successfully logged in with admin@vextrus.com, dashboard loads user info

### ✅ Scenario 2: Finance Module Navigation
- **Status**: PASSED
- **Details**: Finance submenu expands showing Invoices, Payments, Chart of Accounts, Journal Entries

### ⚠️ Scenario 3: Invoice List
- **Status**: PARTIAL
- **Details**: Page loads but GraphQL query fails with "Failed to fetch"
- **Blocker**: Client-side network connectivity issue (server responds correctly to curl)

### ❌ Scenario 4: Invoice Detail
- **Status**: BLOCKED
- **Reason**: Cannot proceed without working invoice list

### ❌ Scenario 5: Chart of Accounts
- **Status**: BLOCKED
- **Reason**: Same GraphQL fetch issue expected

### ❌ Scenario 6: Payments
- **Status**: BLOCKED
- **Reason**: Same GraphQL fetch issue expected

## Technical Findings

### Server-Side Verification ✅
```bash
# CORS Preflight - WORKING
curl -I -X OPTIONS http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST"
# Returns: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000

# GraphQL Query - WORKING
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:3000" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __typename }"}'
# Returns: {"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}
```

### Client-Side Issues ⚠️
- Browser console shows: `Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:4000/graphql' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy`
- Same request works via curl with identical headers
- Possible causes:
  - Browser caching old CORS policy
  - Preflight OPTIONS request timing out
  - Apollo Client configuration issue
  - Docker container rebuild didn't include latest source changes

## Screenshots Captured

1. **Dashboard (Working)**: `.playwright-mcp/dashboard-working.png`
   - Shows user logged in successfully
   - All UI components rendering correctly

2. **Invoice Page (Error State)**: Current browser state
   - Page structure loads correctly
   - Error alert shows "Failed to load invoices: Failed to fetch"
   - Navigation and layout working

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Force browser cache clear**: Hard refresh or incognito mode
2. **Rebuild frontend**: `docker-compose restart web` to pick up any Apollo Client changes
3. **Check Apollo Client config**: Verify httpLink credentials and headers in `apps/web/src/lib/apollo-client.ts`
4. **Docker volume issue**: API Gateway container may need volume mount for hot reload

### Next Steps
1. Resolve GraphQL fetch connectivity between frontend and API Gateway
2. Complete remaining test scenarios (Invoice Detail, Chart of Accounts, Payments)
3. Capture success screenshots for all pages
4. Test invoice creation flow
5. Test data persistence and validation

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
- `services/auth/src/infrastructure/interceptors/graphql-execution-context.interceptor.ts` (new)
- `services/auth/src/app.module.ts` (added interceptor)
- `services/api-gateway/src/main.ts` (CORS configuration)
- `apps/web/src/app/finance/invoices/page.tsx` (Alert variant fix)

### Configuration
- API Gateway CORS now allows `http://localhost:3000`
- Auth service properly handles GraphQL mutations
- Alert component variants standardized

## Summary

**Issues Fixed**: 3/3
**Test Scenarios Passed**: 2/6
**Test Scenarios Blocked**: 4/6
**Screenshots**: 1 captured

### Blockers
- Client-side network fetch failing despite server-side CORS working correctly
- Likely Docker container caching or Apollo Client configuration issue
- Requires additional investigation of browser dev tools network tab and Apollo Client setup

### Success Metrics
- Auth service mutations working ✅
- Component errors resolved ✅
- Server-side CORS configured ✅
- Dashboard fully functional ✅
- Finance navigation working ✅

The foundation is solid - authentication, navigation, and page rendering all work correctly. The remaining blocker is a network connectivity issue that prevents GraphQL queries from reaching the backend, despite the backend being properly configured and accessible via curl.
