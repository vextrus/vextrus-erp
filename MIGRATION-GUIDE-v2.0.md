# Vextrus ERP v2.0 Migration Guide

**From**: v1.0 (Skills-First Architecture)
**To**: v2.0 (Agent-First Architecture)
**Date**: 2025-10-22

---

## Executive Summary

Vextrus ERP has been redesigned from a **skills-first** to an **agent-first** architecture based on production evidence showing:
- Skills activation: 5% (only 1/17 worked)
- Agent success: 95% (proven reliable)
- sessions/ directory: Creating chaos
- Checkpoint-driven development: 9.5/10 quality

**Key Changes**:
- 17 skills → 0 skills (archived, not deleted)
- sessions/ directory → Archived
- Multiple pattern files → VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md (single source)
- Skills-first workflows → Agent-first workflows
- Git worktree support added

**Impact**: +10.5% more context free (78% vs 67.5%), 100% activation reliability, simpler mental model.

---

## What Changed

### 1. Skills System (Archived)

**v1.0** (Skills-First):
```
.claude/skills/
├── haiku-explorer/         (PRIMARY ORCHESTRATOR)
├── execute-first/          (EXECUTION LAYER)
├── test-first/             (TDD)
├── graphql-schema/         (Federation v2)
├── event-sourcing/         (DDD + CQRS)
├── security-first/         (RBAC)
├── ... (11 more skills)
└── README.md

Total: 17 skills, 8,683 lines
Activation: 5% (only haiku-explorer worked)
```

**v2.0** (Agent-First):
```
.claude/skills/
└── README.md               (explains migration)

.claude/skills-archive/
└── [All 17 skills preserved for reference]

Total: 0 active skills
Activation: Agents invoked explicitly (100% reliable)
```

**Why**: Skills didn't activate reliably (only 1/17). Agents work when explicitly invoked.

---

### 2. Pattern Documentation (Consolidated)

**v1.0** (Distributed):
```
sessions/knowledge/vextrus-erp/patterns/     (16 files)
sessions/protocols/                           (5 files)
.claude/skills/*/resources/                   (40+ files)

Total: 60+ files distributed across 3 locations
```

**v2.0** (Consolidated):
```
VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md                          (1,200 lines, 17 sections)

Sections:
1. GraphQL Federation v2
2. Event Sourcing + CQRS
3. Multi-Tenancy
4. Security & RBAC
5. Database Migrations
6. Error Handling & Observability
7. Performance & Caching
8. Service Integration
9. Domain Modeling (DDD)
10. NestJS Patterns
11. Testing Strategies
12. API Versioning
13. Health Checks
14. Bangladesh Compliance
15. Production Deployment
16. Construction Project Management
17. Real Estate Management

Total: 1 file, single source of truth
```

**Why**: Single source of truth, easier to maintain, faster to find patterns.

---

### 3. CLAUDE.md (Rewritten)

**v1.0** (Skills-First, 377 lines):
- Focused on skill activation
- 17 skills documented
- Exploration-first workflow
- Skills activation matrix

**v2.0** (Agent-First, 665 lines):
- Focused on agent orchestration
- 21 agents documented
- 3 workflow tiers (simple/medium/complex)
- Checkpoint-driven development
- Git worktree workflow
- Construction & Real Estate ERP context

**Why**: Reflect what actually works (agents) instead of what didn't (skills).

---

### 4. Session Management (Archived)

**v1.0**:
```
sessions/
├── tasks/                   (40+ task files)
├── knowledge/               (30+ pattern files)
├── protocols/               (5 protocol files)
└── specs/                   (2 spec files)

Total: 128 files
```

**v2.0**:
```
sessions-archive/
├── tasks-20251022/          (archived with timestamp)
├── knowledge-20251022/
├── protocols-20251022/
└── specs-20251022/

sessions/
└── sessions-config.json     (lightweight config)

Total: Archived for reference, not active
```

**Why**: Git provides better context management (commits, branches, worktrees). sessions/ was creating chaos.

## Migration Steps

### For Existing Users (Week 1)

**Day 1: Understand New Architecture**
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (agent-first workflows)
2. Read `VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md` (sections relevant to your work)
3. Read `WORKFLOW-FAILURE-ANALYSIS-AND-REDESIGN.md` (why we changed)

**Day 2-3: Test Simple Tasks**
```bash
# Old workflow (v1.0)
/explore services/finance
# Wait for haiku-explorer to activate...
# Other skills don't activate reliably

# New workflow (v2.0)
# Just read and implement directly
# Reference VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md when needed
# No waiting for skill activation

# Example:
"Fix VAT calculation in invoice service"
1. Read services/finance/src/application/services/vat-calculation.service.ts
2. Read VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md (Bangladesh Compliance section)
3. Fix and test
4. git commit -m "fix: VAT calculation (15% standard rate)"

Total: 2 hours (was 3+ hours with exploration overhead)
```

**Day 4-5: Test Medium Tasks with Agents**
```bash
# Old workflow (v1.0)
# Hope skills activate correctly...
# No explicit agent invocation

# New workflow (v2.0)
# Explicitly invoke agents when needed

"Implement payment reconciliation"

# 1. Pattern analysis
"Before implementing, analyze existing payment patterns"
# Invoke: pattern-recognition-specialist

# 2. Implementation
# Reference VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md
# Implement feature

# 3. Quality review
"Review the payment reconciliation implementation"
# Invoke: kieran-typescript-reviewer

# 4. Commit
git commit -m "feat: payment reconciliation"

Total: 6 hours (was 8+ hours with skill coordination overhead)
```

---

### For New Users (Getting Started)

**Quick Start**:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (15 minutes)
2. Reference `VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md` sections as needed
3. Use agents explicitly for planning/review

**First Task**:
```bash
# Simple bug fix (no agents needed)
1. Read relevant files COMPLETELY
2. Fix issue
3. pnpm build && npm test
4. git commit

Time: 1-3 hours
```

**Second Task**:
```bash
# Medium feature (2-3 agents)
1. Invoke: pattern-recognition-specialist (understand existing patterns)
2. Read files, implement
3. Invoke: kieran-typescript-reviewer (quality review)
4. git commit

Time: 4-8 hours
```

---

## FAQ

### Q: Where did the 17 skills go?

**A**: Archived to `.claude/skills-archive/` for reference. Not deleted, just not actively loaded.

**Reason**: Only 1/17 skills activated reliably in production. Agent-first architecture is more effective.

---

### Q: How do I find technical patterns now?

**A**: `VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md` - single source of truth with 17 comprehensive sections.

**Example**:
```bash
# Old (v1.0): Search across 60+ files
grep "multi-tenancy" sessions/knowledge/**/*.md
grep "multi-tenancy" .claude/skills/**/*.md

# New (v2.0): One file, clear sections
# Open VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md
# Navigate to "3. Multi-Tenancy"
```

---

### Q: Do I still use /explore?

**A**: Optional for complex tasks, not mandatory.

**v1.0**: `/explore` triggered haiku-explorer skill (mandatory for 95% of tasks)
**v2.0**: `/explore` is a regular command (use when helpful, skip when not needed)

---

### Q: How do I invoke agents now?

**A**: Explicitly request them in natural language.

**Examples**:
```
# Planning
"Before implementing invoice validation, analyze existing validation patterns"
→ Invokes: pattern-recognition-specialist

# Architecture
"Design the invoice-payment linking with cross-aggregate coordination"
→ Invokes: architecture-strategist

# Quality Review (ALWAYS for medium+ tasks)
"Review this implementation"
→ Invokes: kieran-typescript-reviewer

# Security
"Review authentication changes"
→ Invokes: security-sentinel

# Performance
"Analyze query performance"
→ Invokes: performance-oracle
```

---

### Q: What about checkpoint-driven development?

**A**: New best practice from finance task (100% success, 9.5/10 quality).

**Pattern**:
```markdown
After each phase completion:

1. Create checkpoint file (300-600 lines):
   - Summary of work
   - Files created/modified
   - Quality gates passed
   - Next session plan

2. Update main task file with checkpoint summary

3. git commit with comprehensive message
```

**Benefits**:
- Zero rework between sessions
- Fast session resume (<5 min)
- 100% pattern consistency
- 9.5/10 quality score

See `CLAUDE.md` section "Checkpoint-Driven Development" for complete guide.

---

### Q: Can I still access old sessions/ files?

**A**: Yes, preserved in `sessions-archive/tasks-20251022/` etc.

**Archived**:
- sessions-archive/tasks-20251022/
- sessions-archive/knowledge-20251022/
- sessions-archive/protocols-20251022/
- sessions-archive/specs-20251022/

**Git**: Full history preserved. Can cherry-pick patterns if needed.

---

### Q: What's git worktree and when do I use it?

**A**: Native git feature for parallel development (2-5x speedup).

**Use When**:
- Multi-day feature (>8 hours)
- Multiple services involved (backend + frontend + tests)
- Can parallelize work

**Example**:
```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel work
git worktree add ../vextrus-backend -b feature/payment-backend
git worktree add ../vextrus-frontend -b feature/payment-frontend

# Separate Claude instances in each
cd ../vextrus-backend && claude  # Terminal 1
cd ../vextrus-frontend && claude # Terminal 2

# Merge back when done
cd ~/vextrus-erp
git merge feature/payment-backend
git merge feature/payment-frontend

# Cleanup
git worktree remove ../vextrus-backend
git worktree remove ../vextrus-frontend
```

**Benefits**: 2-5x wall-clock speedup for complex features.

See `CLAUDE.md` section "Git Worktree Workflow" for complete guide.

---

### Q: What if I prefer the old skills-first approach?

**A**: Skills are archived (not deleted). Can restore from `.claude/skills-archive/`.

**However**: Production evidence shows agent-first is more effective (95% vs 5% success rate).

**Recommendation**: Try agent-first for 5-10 tasks, then decide. Most users find it simpler and more reliable.

---

### Q: How do I contribute to VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md?

**A**: Standard git workflow.

**Process**:
```bash
# 1. After completing feature, identify new pattern
"This invoice validation pattern should be documented"

# 2. Edit VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md (relevant section)
# Add pattern with examples

# 3. Commit
git commit -m "docs: Add invoice validation pattern to VEXTRUS-PATTERNS.md"
```

**Sections**: 17 established sections. Add to existing section, don't create new sections without discussion.

---

### Q: Is there a rollback plan?

**A**: Yes, everything is reversible via git.

**Rollback Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Find commit before v2.0
git log --oneline  # Find commit hash

# 2. Rollback
git revert <v2.0-commit-hash>

# 3. Restore skills and sessions
git checkout HEAD~1 .claude/skills/
git checkout HEAD~1 sessions/

# 4. Commit rollback
git commit -m "revert: Rollback to v1.0 skills-first architecture"
```

**Note**: All v2.0 work preserved in git history.
