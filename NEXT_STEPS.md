# Next Steps - Infrastructure Foundation

## Current Status: 75% Complete

### ‚úÖ Completed in This Session

1. **Fixed Workflow Service TypeScript Errors**
   - Added all missing activity functions
   - Fixed Duration type issues
   - Service now compiles successfully

2. **Fixed API Gateway Service Discovery**
   - Updated all service URLs from `localhost` to Docker service names
   - Fixed Redis configuration
   - All 18 services properly configured

3. **Code Fixes Applied**
   - `/services/workflow/src/activities/index.ts` - Added 9 missing functions
   - `/services/workflow/src/workflows/invoice-approval.workflow.ts` - Fixed type issues
   - `/services/api-gateway/src/config/configuration.ts` - Fixed all service URLs

## üö® Immediate Action Required

### 1. Start Docker Desktop
```bash
# Manually start Docker Desktop from Windows
# Or run:
"C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Docker Desktop.exe"

# Wait for Docker to be ready (check the icon in system tray)
# Then verify:
docker version
```

### 2. Run Recovery Script
```bash
# Once Docker is running:
./recover-infrastructure.sh
```

### 3. Rebuild Services with Fixes
```bash
# Build the services we fixed
docker-compose up -d --build workflow api-gateway

# Check status
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}" | grep vextrus
```

### 4. Deploy New Business Services
```bash
# Start the 6 new services
docker-compose up -d crm finance hr organization project-management scm

# Monitor their startup
docker-compose logs -f crm finance hr organization project-management scm
```

### 5. Test Health Endpoints
```bash
# External health checks
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Auth
curl http://localhost:3002/health  # Master Data
curl http://localhost:3003/health  # Notification

# Internal health checks (from within Docker)
docker exec vextrus-auth curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

## üìã Remaining Tasks (25%)

| Task | Priority | Command/Action |
|------|----------|----------------|
| Start Docker Desktop | CRITICAL | Manual action required |
| Rebuild fixed services | HIGH | `docker-compose up -d --build workflow api-gateway` |
| Deploy new services | HIGH | `docker-compose up -d crm finance hr organization project-management scm` |
| Fix health endpoints | MEDIUM | Check route configurations in each service |
| Setup monitoring | MEDIUM | Access SignOz at http://localhost:8080 |
| Configure API docs | LOW | Setup Swagger/GraphQL playground |
| Run tests | LOW | `npm run test:e2e` |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Docker doesn't start:
1. Check Windows Services for "Docker Desktop Service"
2. Restart WSL: `wsl --shutdown`
3. Check Docker Desktop settings for resource allocation

### If builds fail:
1. Clear Docker cache: `docker system prune -a`
2. Increase Docker memory to 8GB+ in settings
3. Use `--no-cache` flag: `docker-compose build --no-cache`

### If services won't start:
1. Check logs: `docker logs vextrus-[service-name]`
2. Verify database: `docker exec vextrus-postgres psql -U vextrus -l`
3. Check ports: `netstat -an | findstr :[PORT]`

## üéØ Success Criteria

Once Docker is running and services are deployed:
- [ ] All 37 services running (18 app + 19 infrastructure)
- [ ] Health checks passing (http://localhost:3001-3018/health)
- [ ] GraphQL federation working (http://localhost:4000/graphql)
- [ ] SignOz monitoring active (http://localhost:8080)
- [ ] No services in restart loops
- [ ] All databases accessible
