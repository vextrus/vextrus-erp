# Core Service Health Endpoint Test Results
# Generated: 2025-09-26T10:05:00Z

## Summary
- **Total Services Tested**: 13
- **Working Health Endpoints**: 2 (/api/v1/health pattern)  
- **404 Not Found**: 9 endpoints
- **Unreachable Services**: 8 services
- **Services Needing Port Exposure**: 6 services

## Detailed Results

### ‚úÖ WORKING ENDPOINTS
1. **Auth Service (3001)**: `/api/v1/health` ‚úì (200 OK, 19.8ms)
   - Full health checks: database, redis, kafka, memory
2. **Master Data Service (3002)**: `/api/v1/health` ‚úì (200 OK, 3.7ms) 
   - Basic health check with service info
3. **API Gateway (4000)**: `/health` ‚úì (200 OK, 2.8ms)
   - Health checks: memory, graphql

### ‚ùå MISSING HEALTH ENDPOINTS (Running Services)
4. **Workflow Service (3011)**: All patterns return 404
   - Tested: /health, /api/v1/health, /api/health
5. **Rules Engine Service (3012)**: All patterns return 404
   - Tested: /health, /api/v1/health, /api/health

### üîí PORT NOT EXPOSED (Internal Services)
6. **Notification Service (3003)**: Running but port not exposed
7. **Configuration Service (3004)**: Running but port not exposed  
8. **Scheduler Service (3005)**: Running but port not exposed
9. **Audit Service (3009)**: Running but port not exposed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è UNHEALTHY CONTAINER
10. **Document Generator (3006)**: Container unhealthy + port not exposed

### üî¥ SERVICES NOT RUNNING
11. **Import-Export Service (3007)**: Service not started
12. **File Storage Service (3008)**: Service not started
13. **Organization Service (3016)**: Service not started

## Issues Summary

### HIGH PRIORITY
- 3 services not running: import-export, file-storage, organization
- 1 unhealthy container: document-generator

### MEDIUM PRIORITY  
- 2 services missing health endpoints: workflow, rules-engine

### LOW PRIORITY
- 4 services need port exposure for monitoring: notification, configuration, scheduler, audit

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start missing services** or remove from deployment
2. **Fix document-generator container** health issues
3. **Implement health endpoints** in workflow and rules-engine services

### Port Exposure (if monitoring needed)
Add to docker-compose.yml:
- notification: `- 3003:3003`  
- configuration: `- 3004:3004`
- scheduler: `- 3005:3005`
- audit: `- 3009:3009`
- document-generator: `- 3006:3006`

### Standardization
- Use `/api/v1/health` pattern consistently
- Include database/redis/kafka status in health checks
- Follow auth service health check implementation as template

## Health Endpoint Patterns Found
- ‚úÖ `/api/v1/health` - Auth, Master Data (RECOMMENDED)
- ‚úÖ `/health` - API Gateway (works but non-standard)
- ‚ùå Other patterns tested but not found
