**10 Optimization Strategies**:

1. **MCP On-Demand Enabling** (98.6% reduction)
   - 111k tokens → 1.5k tokens
   - When to enable each of 16 MCP servers
   - Context cost table

2. **Task File Size Management** (83.3% reduction)
   - 15k tokens → 2.5k tokens
   - Anti-pattern: 3,168 line task files
   - Best practice: <500 lines with references

3. **Reference > Embed** (96% reduction)
   - 20k tokens → 0.8k tokens
   - Don't copy architecture into task files
   - Reference service CLAUDE.md files

4. **Explore Agent Usage** (97% reduction)
   - 17k tokens → 0.5k tokens
   - Use /explore (Haiku 4.5) instead of manual reading
   - Separate context window

5. **Plugin Subagent Context** (96% reduction)
   - 19k tokens → 0.8k tokens
   - Agents run in separate contexts
   - Parallel execution strategies

6. **Model Selection** (52% reduction)
   - Use Haiku 4.5 for exploration
   - Use Sonnet 4.5 for complexity
   - When to use each

7. **Service CLAUDE.md Pattern**
   - Reference, don't embed
   - Each service has architecture docs

8. **Incremental Loading** (92% reduction)
   - Load context as needed
   - Don't front-load everything

9. **Git Diff vs Full Files** (96% reduction)
   - Use diffs for reviews
   - Not entire file contents

10. **TodoWrite for Tracking** (95% reduction)
    - Use todo list instead of verbose work logs
    - Concise updates

**Real-World Examples**:
- Finance backend task: 185k → 35k tokens (150k savings, 81% reduction)
- Cross-service integration: 48k → 2.9k tokens (45k savings, 94% reduction)

**Context Budget Guidelines**:
- Baseline: 4.2k tokens
- Available: 195.8k tokens (97.9%)
- Recommended allocation by phase

**Warning Signs**:
- 🚨 Context Danger Zone (>60%)
- 🛑 Context Critical (>80%)

**Optimization Checklist**: Before, during, and after task
