## Progress Summary
- **Phase 0**: ✅ COMPLETED
  - Fixed Configuration Service GraphQL issues
  - Started missing infrastructure (minio, rabbitmq)
  - Created service tracking matrix
- **Phase 1**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS
  - Next: Start 10 business services
  - Then: Implement health endpoints
- **Phase 2-5**: ⏳ PENDING

## Key Achievements
1. Configuration Service stabilized after removing GraphQL dependencies
2. All infrastructure services now operational (100%)
3. All core services running (but need health endpoints)
4. Monitoring stack fully operational
5. Improved from 13% to 54% readiness

## Next Steps
1. Start document-generator service
2. Start scheduler service
3. Start import-export service
4. Start file-storage service (depends on minio)
5. Start organization service
6. Start business module services (crm, finance, hr, project-management, scm)
7. Implement health endpoints for all services
