## Daily Workflow (80% of Tasks)

```bash
# 1. Explore (30 seconds, Haiku 4.5)
/explore services/finance

# 2. Direct Execution (Skills load when relevant)
"implement invoice payment with validation"
→ Claude loads relevant skills: execute-first, test-first, graphql-schema, event-sourcing, security-first

# 3. Quality Gates (2-5 minutes)
/review /test /security-scan

# 4. Commit (30 seconds)
git add . && git commit -m "feat: invoice payment"
```

**Total**: 1-4 hours | **Context**: <30k tokens (15%)

---

## Complex Workflow (20% of Tasks)

### Compounding Cycle: PLAN → DELEGATE → ASSESS → CODIFY

**Phase 1: PLAN** (1-3 hours, Sonnet orchestrates)
- Parallel Haiku exploration (2-3 agents)
- Specialized agents (3-5 max): architecture-strategist, pattern-recognition, best-practices-researcher
- Create SpecKit feature spec

**Phase 2: DELEGATE** (2-8 hours, parallel execution)
- Break into subtasks (TodoWrite: 5-15 items)
- Parallel Haiku execution (2-5 agents)
- **2-5x faster** than sequential

**Phase 3: ASSESS** (30 min - 2 hours, 4-level quality)
- Level 1: Automated (/review /security-scan /test pnpm build)
- Level 2: Language-specific (kieran-typescript-reviewer)
- Level 3: Specialized (performance-oracle, security-sentinel, data-integrity-guardian)
- Level 4: Domain-specific (Bangladesh compliance, GraphQL Federation, Event Sourcing)

**Phase 4: CODIFY** (15-45 minutes, learning capture)
- feedback-codifier agent captures patterns
- Update knowledge base
- **Each task 20-40% faster**

## Model Selection Strategy

### By Task Type

| Task Type | Model | Performance | When to Use |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Exploration | Haiku 4.5 | 73% SWE-bench, 2x faster, 1/3 cost | /explore, context gathering, analysis |
| Implementation | Sonnet 4.5 | 77% SWE-bench, best quality | Complex logic, critical code, orchestration |
| Parallel Exploration | Haiku 4.5 | 2-5x wall-clock speed | Multi-service, layered architecture research |
| Quality Review | Sonnet 4.5 | Highest accuracy | Code review, security audit, architecture decisions |

### By Skill

| Skill | Primary Model | Why |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| haiku-explorer | Haiku 4.5 | Fast exploration, minimal context |
| execute-first | Sonnet 4.5 | Orchestrates other skills, quality critical |
| test-first | Sonnet 4.5 | TDD requires careful test design |
| graphql-schema | Sonnet 4.5 | Federation v2 complexity |
| event-sourcing | Sonnet 4.5 | CQRS/DDD patterns need precision |
| security-first | Sonnet 4.5 | Security cannot compromise |
| database-migrations | Sonnet 4.5 | Zero-downtime patterns critical |
| multi-tenancy | Sonnet 4.5 | Isolation bugs are catastrophic |
| production-deployment | Sonnet 4.5 | Production requires highest quality |
| All Advanced Skills | Sonnet 4.5 | Specialized patterns need accuracy |

**Parallel Execution**: Multiple Haiku agents = 2-5x wall-clock speed, 98.6% context savings

## Service Architecture

**18 NestJS Microservices** | GraphQL Federation v2 | PostgreSQL | EventStore

**Production (11)**: auth, master-data, notification, configuration, scheduler, document-generator, import-export, file-storage, audit, workflow, rules-engine

**In Progress (7)**: finance (Day 1/18), crm, hr, project-management, scm, inventory, reporting

**Before modifying**: `cat services/<name>/CLAUDE.md`

## Agent Usage (Optimized: 21 agents, 5.8k tokens)

**Current State** (2025-10-20):
- **17 compounding-engineering agents** + 4 built-in = 21 total
- **Context**: 5.8k tokens (2.9%) ✅
- **Optimization**: 206 → 21 agents (90% reduction, 7.2k tokens saved)

**Essential Agents** (compounding-engineering plugin):
- architecture-strategist (258 tokens) - System design decisions
- kieran-typescript-reviewer (433 tokens) - Code quality bar
- performance-oracle (383 tokens) - Performance optimization
- security-sentinel (388 tokens) - Security audits
- data-integrity-guardian (270 tokens) - Database safety
- feedback-codifier (267 tokens) - Learning capture
- pattern-recognition-specialist (280 tokens) - Pattern analysis
- best-practices-researcher (511 tokens) - External research
- framework-docs-researcher (431 tokens) - Library documentation
- repo-research-analyst (434 tokens) - Codebase archaeology
- pr-comment-resolver (272 tokens) - PR feedback implementation

**Use Agents For** (selective, <3 per task):
- Security-critical (security-sentinel)
- Performance optimization (performance-oracle)
- Architecture decisions (architecture-strategist)
- Code quality review (kieran-*-reviewer)
- Pattern extraction (pattern-recognition-specialist)

**Skip Agents For** (Skills handle 80%):
- Simple features (<100 lines)
- Bug fixes
- CRUD operations
- Test writing
- GraphQL schemas
- Domain aggregates

**Skills vs Agents Decision Tree**:
```
Is this a common pattern?
├─ Yes → Use skill (execute-first, test-first, etc.)
│  └─ Skill loads relevant knowledge automatically
│
└─ No → Is this specialized review/analysis?
   ├─ Yes → Use agent (security-sentinel, performance-oracle)
   └─ No → Use skill (skills cover 80% of tasks)
```

## Context Optimization (Fully Optimized)

**Current Context Breakdown** (65k/200k, 32.5%):
- System prompt: 4.6k (2.3%)
- System tools: 20.3k (10.1%)
- MCP tools: 1.5k (0.7%) ✅
- **Custom agents: 5.8k (2.9%)** ✅ **(Optimized from 13.0k!)**
- **Skills: <10k (5%)** ✅ **(Progressive disclosure)**
- Memory files: 3.6k (1.8%)
- Free space: **135k (67.5%)** ✅

**Agent Optimization** (2025-10-20):
- Before: 206 agents = 13.0k tokens (6.5%)
- After: 21 agents = 5.8k tokens (2.9%)
- **Savings: 7.2k tokens (55% reduction)**

**Skills Optimization** (Session 6 Complete):
- 17 skills with progressive disclosure
- Only load when triggered by keywords
- Average <5% context per task
- Core Skills: 500+ lines each with auto_load_knowledge
- Advanced Skills: 500+ lines each with specialized patterns

**MCP On-Demand**: Enable only when needed
- Default: `sequential-thinking` (1.5k tokens, 0.7% context)
- On-demand: `@postgres`, `@docker`, `@github`, `@serena`

**Task Files**: Reference, don't embed
- Target: <500 lines (optimal)
- Maximum: 1,000 lines
- Use `/explore` instead of reading 10+ files

**Total Context Savings**: 22.2k tokens (from 80k to 65k in fresh session)

## When to Use Protocols

**Simple Tasks (<1 day, <100 lines)**: Skip protocols, skills handle it
**Complex Tasks (multi-day, >100 lines)**: Use `sessions/protocols/`

**5 Core Protocols**:
1. `task-startup.md` - Systematic initialization
2. `task-completion.md` - Quality gates, archival
3. `compounding-cycle.md` - PLAN→DELEGATE→ASSESS→CODIFY
4. `task-creation.md` - Task file structure
5. `context-compaction.md` - Context reset preparation

---

## Performance Standards

| Metric | Good | Acceptable |
|--------|------|------------|
| API Endpoints | <300ms | <500ms |
| DB Queries | <100ms | <250ms |
| Page Loads | <2s | <3s |

---

## Quality Gates (Non-Negotiable)

### Automated (2-5 minutes)
```bash
/review           # Code quality, patterns
/security-scan    # SAST analysis
/test             # Unit + integration
pnpm build        # TypeScript compilation
```
**Fail = Block commit**

### Advanced (Medium/Complex, 15-45 minutes)
- architecture-strategist (system design)
- kieran-typescript-reviewer (code quality)
- performance-oracle (bottlenecks)
- security-sentinel (security audit)
- data-integrity-guardian (database safety)

### Domain-Specific (15-30 minutes)
- **Bangladesh Compliance**: VAT, TIN, Mushak-6.3, fiscal year
- **GraphQL Federation**: @key directives, pagination, error handling
- **Event Sourcing**: Versioning, idempotency, replay safety

## Troubleshooting

**Agent output truncated?**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16384
```

**Skills not activating?**
- Restart Claude Code (skills load at startup)
- Use explicit trigger words (see Skill Activation Matrix)
- Check `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` frontmatter
- Verify trigger words match the 17 skills listed above

**Context bloat?**
- Apply `sessions/protocols/context-compaction.md`
- Refactor task file to <500 lines
- Use reference pattern, not embed
- Enable MCPs on-demand only
- Skills use progressive disclosure (<5% context)

**Parallel agents fail?**
- Verify no hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
- Should only show schema reference
- Restart after removing hooks

**Which skill for my task?**
- See Skill Activation Matrix above
- Check `.claude/skills/README.md` lines 461-520
- Most common: execute-first + haiku-explorer (85%)
