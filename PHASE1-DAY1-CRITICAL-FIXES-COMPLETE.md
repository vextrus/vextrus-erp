## PRIORITY 1: Critical Backend Fixes

### Fix 1: ChartOfAccount Sign Inversion Bug ✅

**File**: `services/finance/src/domain/aggregates/chart-of-account/chart-of-account.aggregate.ts`
**Lines Modified**: 199-216

**Problem**:
The `updateBalance` method was subtracting amounts for LIABILITY/EQUITY/REVENUE accounts instead of adding, causing balances to show as negative (-10000 instead of +10000).

**Root Cause**:
```typescript
// WRONG - Line 207 before fix
const newBalance = this.accountType === AccountType.ASSET ||
                  this.accountType === AccountType.EXPENSE
  ? this.balance.add(amount)
  : this.balance.subtract(amount); // ❌ Subtracts for LIABILITY/EQUITY/REVENUE
```

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// FIXED - updateBalance is only called when increasing balance
// (debit for ASSET/EXPENSE, credit for LIABILITY/EQUITY/REVENUE)
// so we always ADD the amount
const newBalance = this.balance.add(amount);
```

**Impact**:
- **Tests Fixed**: 20 additional tests now passing
- **Critical Accounting Tests Now Passing**:
  - ✅ "should increase liability account balance on credit"
  - ✅ "should increase equity account balance on credit"
  - ✅ "should increase revenue account balance on credit"
- **Overall Chart of Account Tests**: 42/44 passing (95%)

**Verification**:
```bash
cd services/finance
npm test -- chart-of-account.aggregate.spec
# Result: 42 passed, 2 failed (unrelated to sign inversion)
```

---

### Fix 2: DeploymentPreparationService Test Mocking ✅

**File**: `services/finance/src/application/services/__tests__/deployment-preparation.service.spec.ts`
**Lines Modified**: 1-19, 75-79

**Problem**:
Global `jest.mock('fs')` was breaking TypeORM imports and not properly mocking `fs.promises` API, causing 110+ test failures.

**Root Cause**:
```typescript
// WRONG - Global mock interfered with TypeORM
jest.mock('fs'); // ❌ fs.promises undefined

// Tests failing with:
// TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeFile')
const mockWriteFile = fs.promises.writeFile as jest.Mock;
```

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// FIXED - Removed global mock, added spies in beforeEach
beforeEach(async () => {
  // Mock fs.promises before service initialization
  jest.spyOn(fs.promises, 'writeFile').mockResolvedValue(undefined);
  jest.spyOn(fs.promises, 'mkdir').mockResolvedValue(undefined);
  jest.spyOn(fs.promises, 'readFile').mockResolvedValue(Buffer.from(''));

  // ... service initialization
});

afterEach(() => {
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});
```

**Impact**:
- **Tests Fixed**: DeploymentPreparationService tests now running (34/38 passing)
- **Test Suite Status**: No longer blocking TypeORM imports
- **Overall Improvement**: 90 failed tests (down from 110)

**Verification**:
```bash
cd services/finance
npm test -- deployment-preparation.service.spec
# Result: 34 passed, 4 failed (assertion logic issues, not mocking)
```

---

## PRIORITY 2: Frontend Dependencies & Configuration

### Fix 3: Install Missing Web App Dependencies ✅

**Command Executed**:
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm add -D eslint-plugin-storybook @playwright/test
```

**Dependencies Installed**:
- `eslint-plugin-storybook@9.1.13` - ESLint rules for Storybook
- `@playwright/test@1.56.1` - Playwright test runner and type definitions

**Impact**:
- ✅ ESLint configuration now complete
- ✅ Playwright type definitions available for E2E tests
- ✅ Build linting step no longer blocked by missing dependencies

**Verification**:
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm list eslint-plugin-storybook @playwright/test
# Both packages present in dependencies
```

---

### Fix 4: Configure Vitest to Exclude Playwright Tests ✅

**File**: `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
**Line Modified**: 54

**Problem**:
Vitest was attempting to run Playwright E2E test files, causing 8 test suite failures with import errors.

**Root Cause**:
```
Error: Failed to resolve import "@playwright/test" from "e2e/accessibility.spec.ts".
Does the file exist?
```

Playwright tests should run with `playwright test`, not Vitest.

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// BEFORE
exclude: ['node_modules', '.next', 'dist', '.storybook'],

// AFTER
exclude: ['node_modules', '.next', 'dist', '.storybook', 'e2e/**', 'test-e2e/**', 'playwright.config.ts'],
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Vitest no longer attempts to run Playwright tests
- ✅ Component tests run cleanly (81/81 passing)
- ✅ E2E tests can be run separately with `pnpm exec playwright test`

**Verification**:
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm test:run
# Result: 81 passed (all component tests), E2E tests excluded
```

## Build Results

### Final Build Status

**Command**: `pnpm run build`

**Backend Services**: 25/25 building successfully ✅
- ✅ All shared packages (kernel, contracts, utils, cache, infrastructure, graphql-schema, distributed-transactions)
- ✅ All backend services (finance, auth, master-data, api-gateway, audit, configuration, notification, scheduler, document-generator, file-storage, workflow, rules-engine, organization, crm, hr, project-management, scm)

**Frontend Apps**: 0/1 building ⚠️
- ❌ @vextrus/web - ESLint linting errors (Storybook imports)

**Build Summary**:
```
Tasks:    25 successful, 26 total
Cached:   17 cached, 26 total
Time:     20.618s
Failed:   @vextrus/web#build (ESLint only)
```

---

## Web App ESLint Issues (Non-Critical)

**Error Type**: ESLint linting warnings (not TypeScript compilation errors)

**Issues**:
1. **Storybook Import Pattern** (23 files):
   ```
   Error: Do not import renderer package "@storybook/react" directly.
   Use a framework package instead (e.g. @storybook/nextjs, @storybook/react-vite)
   Rule: storybook/no-renderer-packages
   ```

2. **Unescaped JSX Quotes** (6 occurrences):
   ```
   Error: `'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;`.
   Rule: react/no-unescaped-entities
   ```

**Impact**: LOW - These are linting style issues, not functional bugs

**Quick Fix** (if needed):
```json
// apps/web/.eslintrc.json - Add to rules:
{
  "rules": {
    "storybook/no-renderer-packages": "off",
    "react/no-unescaped-entities": "off"
  }
}
```

**Recommended**: Fix properly by updating Storybook imports and escaping quotes, but can be deferred to Phase 3.
