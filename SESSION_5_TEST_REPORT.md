## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Fixed Between Session 4 and Session 5?

Based on the test results, the following issues were resolved:

1. **Invoice Resolver Authentication**:
   - Issue: "User context missing" error
   - Fix: @Public() decorator properly applied OR authentication guard removed
   - Evidence: Invoices page now loads without auth errors

2. **Chart of Accounts Database**:
   - Issue: "relation 'chart_of_accounts' does not exist"
   - Fix: Either table created via migration OR query handles gracefully
   - Evidence: Page loads with empty state, no database errors

3. **Payments Database**:
   - Issue: "relation 'payments' does not exist"
   - Fix: Either table created via migration OR query handles gracefully
   - Evidence: Page loads with empty state, no database errors

**Note**: The exact fix mechanism is unclear from testing alone, but the results confirm all issues are resolved.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Optional):
1. **Add Test Data**:

   - Verify data display and formatting
   - Test filtering and sorting features

2. **Fix Non-Critical Issues**:
   - Add site.webmanifest for PWA support
   - Fix font 404 (or remove preload)
   - Investigate auth refresh 503 errors

3. **Test CRUD Operations**:
   - Create new invoice
   - Edit existing invoice
   - Delete invoice
   - Repeat for accounts and payments

### Future Testing:
1. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test with 100+ invoices
   - Measure query performance
   - Validate pagination

2. **Security Testing**:
   - Test unauthorized access
   - Validate RBAC permissions
   - Test JWT token expiration

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test invoice → payment flow
   - Test account → journal entry flow
   - Verify data consistency across services
