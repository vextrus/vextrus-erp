# Setup Development Environment and Project Foundation

## Problem/Goal
Initialize Vextrus ERP development environment with Docker Compose, create the NestJS monolith structure with proper module boundaries, and implement basic authentication service as the foundation for all other modules.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Docker Compose environment running with PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka
- [x] NestJS project initialized with modular monolith structure
- [x] Basic authentication service with JWT implementation
- [x] Database migrations setup with TypeORM
- [x] Development workflow documented and tested
- [x] Basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [x] SigNoz monitoring stack configured
- [x] Git repository structured with proper .gitignore

## Technical Requirements

### Docker Services
```yaml
services:
  postgres:    # v16 - Primary database
  redis:       # v7 - Caching and sessions
  kafka:       # Event streaming
  zookeeper:   # Kafka dependency
  signoz:      # Monitoring stack
```

```

### Authentication Service Features
- User registration with validation
- Login with JWT (15min access, 7day refresh)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Basic RBAC structure
- Audit logging for auth events

### Database Setup
- TypeORM configuration
- Initial migration for users table
- Audit columns on all tables
- Multi-tenant structure preparation

## User Notes
<!-- Rizvi's requirements -->
- Start simple, we'll evolve to microservices later
- Focus on getting the foundation right
- Use environment variables for all configurations
- Ensure Bengali (UTF-8) support from the start
- Follow the modular monolith pattern strictly
- No direct module-to-module calls, use events

## Implementation Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Create docker-compose.yml with all services
   - Configure environment variables (.env.example)
   - Test all services are running

2. **NestJS Initialization**
   - Initialize NestJS project with CLI
   - Setup module structure
   - Configure TypeORM with PostgreSQL
   - Setup event bus for inter-module communication

3. **Auth Service Implementation**
   - User entity with TypeORM
   - Registration endpoint
   - Login endpoint with JWT
   - Token refresh endpoint
   - Basic guards and decorators

4. **Testing Setup**
   - Unit tests for auth service
   - Integration tests with test database
   - E2E tests for API endpoints

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Linting and formatting checks
   - Test execution
   - Docker image building
