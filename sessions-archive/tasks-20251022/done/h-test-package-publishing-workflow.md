# Test and Productionize Package Publishing Workflow

## Problem/Goal
The package publishing infrastructure has been implemented with Verdaccio, Changesets, tsup, and GitHub Actions. Now we need to test the workflow end-to-end, configure production registry options, add security measures like package signing, and set up monitoring for the publishing pipeline.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test publishing workflow end-to-end with all packages
- [ ] Configure production registry (evaluate NPM Enterprise vs GitHub Packages)
- [ ] Implement package signing for security
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts for registry and publishing
- [ ] Create automated testing for publishing pipeline
- [ ] Document production deployment procedures
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning for published packages
- [ ] Implement retention policies for package versions

## Context Manifest

### Current Infrastructure Status
- **Verdaccio**: Local private registry running in Docker at port 4873
- **Changesets**: Configured for fixed versioning of @vextrus packages
- **tsup**: Modern bundling with dual ESM/CJS output for all packages
- **GitHub Actions**: Release workflow configured but not tested
- **TypeDoc**: Documentation generation configured

### Available Packages
1. **@vextrus/kernel** (1.0.0) - DDD primitives
2. **@vextrus/contracts** (1.0.0) - Service contracts
3. **@vextrus/utils** (1.0.0) - Utilities and observability
4. **@vextrus/distributed-transactions** (1.0.0) - Transaction patterns

## Technical Requirements

### End-to-End Testing
- Verify local publishing to Verdaccio
- Test package installation from registry
- Validate version bumping with changesets
- Test GitHub Actions workflow in fork/branch
- Verify documentation generation

### Production Registry Options
1. **NPM Enterprise**
   - Private packages with team management
   - Built-in security scanning
   - Access tokens and 2FA
   
2. **GitHub Packages**
   - Integrated with GitHub repos
   - Free for public packages
   - Supports npm, Docker, Maven
   
3. **Self-hosted Verdaccio**
   - Full control over infrastructure
   - Custom authentication options
   - Need to manage backups/scaling

### Security Implementation
- GPG signing for packages
- Vulnerability scanning with npm audit
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- Access control and audit logging
- Registry authentication tokens

### Monitoring Setup
- Registry availability monitoring
- Package download metrics
- Publishing failure alerts
- Storage usage tracking
- Security vulnerability notifications

## Implementation Steps

1. **End-to-End Testing Phase**
   - Start Verdaccio and verify health
   - Create test changeset
   - Build all packages
   - Publish to local registry
   - Install in test project
   - Verify functionality

2. **Production Registry Evaluation**
   - Compare costs and features
   - Test GitHub Packages integration
   - Evaluate security features
   - Make recommendation

3. **Security Implementation**
   - Set up GPG keys for signing
   - Configure npm signature verification
   - Implement vulnerability scanning
   - Set up SBOM generation

4. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Configure Datadog/Grafana dashboards
   - Set up alerting rules
   - Implement log aggregation
   - Create runbooks

5. **Documentation**
   - Production deployment guide
   - Security procedures
   - Incident response plan
   - Recovery procedures

## User Notes
<!-- Rizvi's requirements -->
- Start with local testing before production
- Security is critical - implement signing
- Need monitoring for production reliability
- Keep documentation updated
- Consider disaster recovery

## Work Log
<!-- Updated as work progresses -->
- [2025-09-08] Task created to test and productionize package publishing workflow
- [2025-09-08] Successfully completed end-to-end testing of package publishing workflow:
  - Fixed Verdaccio authentication issues (E401 errors) by updating htpasswd and .npmrc configuration
  - Resolved tsup build issues with TypeScript incremental compilation by disabling it in DTS config
  - Built and published all 4 packages to Verdaccio registry:
    - @vextrus/kernel@1.0.0
    - @vextrus/contracts@1.0.0  
    - @vextrus/utils@1.0.0
    - @vextrus/distributed-transactions@1.0.0
  - Fixed circular dependency issues between packages
  - Removed non-existent Injectable decorator imports
  - Created test-integration project and verified all packages install and work correctly
  - Successfully tested changeset version bumping (1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1)
  - Generated CHANGELOG.md files for all packages
  
### Issues Resolved:
- Verdaccio authentication: Changed from username/password to base64 auth token
- tsup DTS errors: Disabled incremental/composite compilation
- Package dependencies: Fixed workspace:* references to specific versions
- Import errors: Removed Injectable decorator references that didn't exist

### Next Steps:
- Test GitHub Actions workflow in a feature branch
- Evaluate production registry options (NPM vs GitHub Packages)
- Implement package signing and security measures
- Set up monitoring and alerting
