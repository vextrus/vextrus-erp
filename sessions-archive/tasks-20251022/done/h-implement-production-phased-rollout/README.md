# Production Phased Rollout - Finance Service

## Problem/Goal

**Mission**: Deploy Finance service to production using a **phased rollout strategy** to minimize risk and ensure maximum confidence.

Following the **Option 3: Phased Rollout (SAFEST)** approach from the Backend Production Readiness Certification, we will:
- Fix critical security vulnerabilities incrementally
- Implement performance optimizations gradually
- Scale user capacity week-by-week (10% → 30% → 60% → 100%)
- Monitor metrics and validate at each phase
- Maintain zero downtime throughout rollout

**Why This Approach**:
- **Lowest Risk**: Issues caught early with minimal user impact
- **Maximum Confidence**: Validated at each phase before scaling
- **Learning Opportunities**: Real production data informs optimizations
- **Rollback Safety**: Can revert at any phase if issues detected

**References**:
- Certification: `BACKEND_PRODUCTION_READINESS_CERTIFICATION.md`
- Security Report: `FINANCE_SERVICE_SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- Performance Report: `FINANCE_SERVICE_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
- Constitution: `memory/constitution.md`

- **Integration**: Master Data, Auth, Notification (stability required)

**Deployment Strategy**: Blue-Green with percentage-based rollout
- Week 1: 10% traffic to new version
- Week 2: 30% traffic to new version
- Week 3: 60% traffic to new version
- Week 4: 100% traffic to new version

**Rollback Plan**: Available at every phase
- Monitor key metrics in real-time
- Automated rollback if error rate >1%
- Manual rollback available within 5 minutes
- Blue environment maintained until Week 4 completion

**Monitoring Stack**:
- Prometheus + Grafana (metrics)
- SigNoz (distributed tracing)
- Kafka (event streaming)
- PostgreSQL query logs
- EventStore metrics

---

## Approach

This is a **COMPLEX, MULTI-WEEK** task following the **Phased Rollout** strategy:

### Week-by-Week Breakdown

**Week 1** (9 hours): Critical Security Fixes + Limited Rollout
- Subtask: `01-week1-security-fixes.md`
- Focus: Remove production blockers
- Output: 0 critical vulnerabilities, 10% users deployed

**Week 2** (10 hours): Performance Optimization
- Subtask: `02-week2-performance-optimization.md`
- Focus: N+1 fixes, Redis caching
- Output: 30 concurrent users, <300ms P95

**Week 3** (12 hours): Security Hardening
- Subtask: `03-week3-security-hardening.md`
- Focus: Rate limiting, RBAC, tenant isolation
- Output: 60 concurrent users, 0 high vulns

**Week 4** (8 hours): Full Production Deployment
- Subtask: `04-week4-full-production.md`
- Focus: Snapshots, 100% rollout, monitoring
- Output: 100 concurrent users, production-ready

**Total Effort**: 39 hours spread over 4 weeks

## Risk Management

### High Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Security Vulnerability Exploited During Week 1**
- **Mitigation**: Deploy to 10% internal users first, fix critical issues immediately
- **Rollback**: Blue environment available, <5 min rollback time
- **Detection**: Real-time security monitoring, alerting on suspicious activity

**Risk 2: Performance Degradation at Scale**
- **Mitigation**: Load test at each phase before scaling
- **Rollback**: Automatic traffic reduction if P95 >500ms
- **Detection**: Prometheus alerts, SigNoz tracing

**Risk 3: Data Corruption or Loss**
- **Mitigation**: EventStore immutability, PostgreSQL backups every 6 hours
- **Rollback**: Replay events from EventStore
- **Detection**: Data integrity checks, audit logs

**Risk 4: Third-Party Integration Failures**
- **Mitigation**: Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, Master Data fallbacks
- **Rollback**: Disable integrations, use cached data
- **Detection**: Health check monitoring, integration logs

### Medium Risks

- User confusion during rollout (Mitigation: Clear communication, staged rollout)
- Kafka message delays (Mitigation: Monitor queue depth, scale consumers)
- Database connection exhaustion (Mitigation: Connection pooling tuned, monitoring)
- Cache stampede on Redis restart (Mitigation: Cache warming, staggered key expiry)

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers
- Error rate >1% sustained for 5 minutes
- P95 latency >500ms sustained for 5 minutes
- Critical health check failures

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. **Immediate** (5 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Reduce traffic to new version to 0%
   kubectl set image deployment/finance-service app=vextrus/finance:stable
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/finance-service
   ```

2. **Verify** (2 minutes):
   - Check error rate returns to <0.5%
   - Verify P95 latency <300ms
   - Confirm all health checks green

3. **Investigate** (1 hour):
   - Review logs in SigNoz
   - Analyze error patterns
   - Identify root cause

4. **Fix & Redeploy** (varies):
   - Apply fixes in staging
   - Retest thoroughly
   - Redeploy with cautious monitoring

## Decisions Made

**2025-10-16**: Selected Option 3 (Phased Rollout) over other deployment strategies
- **Rationale**: Lowest risk, maximum confidence, gradual scaling allows early issue detection
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Option 1 (Fix-First): Higher upfront cost, delayed time to market
  - Option 2 (Soft Launch): Higher risk, security vulnerabilities exposed
- **Reference**: Backend Production Readiness Certification

**2025-10-16**: Use percentage-based traffic splitting (10% → 30% → 60% → 100%)
- **Rationale**: Allows precise control, gradual user exposure, easy rollback
- **Alternatives**: Feature flags (too complex), canary releases (similar, but less flexible)
- **Reference**: Kubernetes deployment strategies

**2025-10-16**: Maintain blue-green deployment throughout rollout
- **Rationale**: Instant rollback capability, zero downtime, confidence in production stability
- **Alternatives**: Rolling updates (higher risk), recreate strategy (downtime)
- **Reference**: Constitution principle: zero downtime deployments

## Subtasks

Each week has a dedicated subtask file:
1. `01-week1-security-fixes.md` - Critical security vulnerabilities + 10% deployment
2. `02-week2-performance-optimization.md` - N+1 fixes, Redis caching + 30% deployment
3. `03-week3-security-hardening.md` - Rate limiting, RBAC + 60% deployment
4. `04-week4-full-production.md` - Snapshots, 100% deployment, production monitoring

**Execution Order**: Sequential (Week 1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
**Dependencies**: Each week depends on previous week's success

---

**Philosophy**: "Deploy gradually, monitor continuously, rollback confidently."

**Critical Success Factor**: Validate at each phase, never rush to next phase without meeting quality gates.
