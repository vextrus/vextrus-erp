# Task: Implement Core Finance Module - Enterprise Architecture

## Task ID: h-implement-core-finance-module

## Status: COMPLETE (Phase 6 - Frontend Implemented)

## Priority: CRITICAL

> **Note**: This is the enhanced version with comprehensive research. See [h-implement-core-finance-module-enhanced.md](./h-implement-core-finance-module-enhanced.md) for detailed architecture.

## Context

### Current Situation
- Infrastructure: 100% operational (all 13 services running)
- Business Logic: Only 35% implemented across system

- Frontend: 0% implemented (no UI available)

### Research Findings
Based on comprehensive infrastructure analysis:

1. **Critical Gap**: Finance service has ZERO business logic implemented
2. **Dependencies**: Other modules (HR, SCM, Projects) depend on finance
3. **Compliance Need**: Bangladesh VAT (15%), fiscal year (July-June), NBR requirements
4. **Integration Points**: Ready - Auth, Master-data, Audit services fully functional

## Objective

## Work Log

### 2025-09-28 - Phase 1: Foundation Complete

#### Completed
- Created 4-layer architecture structure (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation)
- Implemented ChartOfAccount entity with NBR-compliant codes (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX format)
- Implemented JournalEntry aggregate with double-entry validation rules

- Separated tax calculation into dedicated service for Bangladesh rules

#### Discovered
- Event Store provides excellent audit trail for financial transactions

- Add validation middleware for Bangladesh compliance
- Create integration tests for all workflows

### Discovered During Implementation
**Date: 2025-09-28 / Session: h-implement-core-finance-module Phase 1**

During Phase 1 implementation, we discovered that the finance module required more sophisticated architectural patterns than originally planned. The original context focused on basic accounting operations, but the actual implementation revealed the need for comprehensive event sourcing and domain-driven design patterns.

We implemented a full **Event Sourcing architecture** with an EventStore entity and service, providing complete audit trails for all financial transactions. This wasn't documented in the original context because we initially planned basic audit logging, but financial transactions require immutable event streams for regulatory compliance and financial investigation capabilities.

The **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns** were extensively used with aggregate roots, domain events, and repository patterns. The JournalEntry became a sophisticated aggregate that manages business rules and emits domain events for state changes. This is crucial for financial integrity and integration with other modules.

**Construction industry specialization** required dedicated entities (WorkOrder, WorkCertification) with complex business logic for retention money (5-10%), progress billing, and certification workflows. These entities go far beyond basic invoicing and represent a specialized domain that affects accounting differently than general business transactions.

The **Bangladesh tax calculation service** became much more comprehensive than basic VAT compliance, including AIT (Advanced Income Tax), TDS (Tax Deducted at Source), import duties, and construction-specific tax scenarios. The service handles thresholds, exemptions, and complex rate calculations based on vendor types and service categories.

Future implementations need to understand that:
- Financial transactions require event sourcing for compliance and auditability
- Construction finance is a specialized domain requiring dedicated entities and workflows
- Bangladesh tax compliance involves multiple tax types with complex interdependencies
- The 4-layer architecture (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation) is essential for maintainability

#### Updated Technical Details
- **Event Store**: Immutable event streams for all financial transactions
- **Domain Aggregates**: ChartOfAccount, JournalEntry, WorkOrder, WorkCertification with business rules
- **Tax Service**: Comprehensive Bangladesh tax calculations (VAT, AIT, TDS, import duties)
- **Construction Entities**: Specialized work order management with retention and certification workflows
- **Repository Pattern**: Complete CRUD operations with business logic separation and hierarchy validation

### 2025-09-28 - Phase 2: Construction Finance Features Complete

#### Completed
- Implemented Invoice entity with comprehensive domain events and Bangladesh tax compliance
- Created InvoiceLineItem entity with construction-specific fields (work order items, BOQ, progress billing)
- Implemented Invoice application service with full approval workflow and journal entry generation
- Created Payment entity with support for all Bangladesh payment methods (bKash, Nagad, Rocket)
- Implemented PaymentAllocation entity for linking payments to invoices
- Created Payment application service with allocation logic, auto-allocation, and reconciliation
- Implemented comprehensive Financial Reports service:
  - Trial Balance with opening/closing balances
  - Income Statement with gross profit and margin calculations
  - Balance Sheet with working capital and ratio analysis
  - General Ledger with running balances
  - VAT Report for NBR compliance with TIN/BIN tracking
  - Cash Flow Statement with operating/investing/financing activities
- Extended GraphQL schema with all new entities, operations, and Bangladesh-specific fields

#### Technical Achievements
- **Invoice Management**: Full lifecycle from draft to paid with approval workflow
- **Payment Processing**: Complete allocation system with reconciliation support
- **Tax Compliance**: Integrated VAT (15%), AIT (2-10%), TDS (0.5-10%) calculations

- **Mobile Payments**: Native support for bKash, Nagad, Rocket, Upay
- **Financial Reports**: All standard reports with NBR compliance built-in
- **Event Sourcing**: All transactions tracked with domain events for audit trail

#### Key Integrations
- Invoice approval automatically creates journal entries
- Payment approval generates accounting transactions
- Invoice-Payment allocation maintains balance tracking
- All operations maintain event store for complete audit trail
- Reports pull from posted journal entries for accuracy

#### Next Steps
- Phase 3: Implement GraphQL resolvers to connect schema to services
- Phase 4: Add validation middleware for Bangladesh-specific rules
- Phase 5: Create integration tests for all workflows
- Phase 6: Implement frontend components for testing
- Phase 7: Add payment gateway integrations (SSLCommerz, bKash API)

## Notes

This task addresses the most critical gap identified in the infrastructure analysis. The Finance module is the foundation of any ERP system and enables value delivery even without a frontend (via API testing). Bangladesh-specific requirements are built in from the start to avoid costly refactoring later.

Phase 1 (Foundation) has been completed successfully with event sourcing architecture, NBR compliance, and construction industry features.

Phase 2 (Construction Finance Features) has been completed with full invoice management, payment processing, and comprehensive financial reporting.
