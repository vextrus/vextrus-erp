# Task: Complete Core Services Production Infrastructure

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 2 days
**Branch**: feature/complete-production-infrastructure
**Prerequisite**: Phase 3 infrastructure services completed

## Context

During Phase 3 implementation, we successfully added production infrastructure (metrics, migrations, health checks) to all 7 infrastructure services but completely missed the 5 core business services that are equally critical for production readiness. Without these, the system cannot function properly in production.

## Current State Analysis

### Infrastructure Services (‚úÖ COMPLETE - 7 services)
- audit, notification, file-storage, document-generator, scheduler, configuration, import-export
- All have: Metrics ‚úÖ, Health Checks ‚úÖ, Migrations ‚úÖ, Kafka ‚úÖ, GraphQL ‚úÖ

### Core Business Services (‚ùå INCOMPLETE - 5 services)
| Service | Metrics | Health | Migrations | Kafka | GraphQL | Critical Gap |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|-------|---------|--------------|
| Auth | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Cannot monitor authentication |
| Master Data | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | Cannot track data operations |
| Workflow | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | No process monitoring |
| Rules Engine | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | No rule evaluation metrics |
| API Gateway | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | N/A | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | No gateway performance data |

## Impact of These Gaps

1. **Cannot deploy to Kubernetes** - No health/readiness probes
2. **Cannot monitor system health** - No metrics endpoints
3. **Database initialization will fail** - No migrations
4. **Event-driven features broken** - Missing Kafka integration
5. **No visibility into core operations** - Authentication, data operations, workflows invisible

## Remaining Implementation Plan

### Phase 4: Entity Creation & Migrations (3 hours)
**Services**: workflow, rules-engine
- Create entity files for workflow service: Process, Task, Execution, Transition, Assignment
- Create entity files for rules-engine service: Rule, Condition, Action, Evaluation, Category
- Generate TypeORM migrations for new entities
- Ensure multi-tenant support and Bangladesh-specific fields

### Phase 5: Kafka Integration (1 hour)
**Services**: workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway
- Complete Kafka setup for remaining services
- Create topics: workflow.process.*, rules.evaluation.*, gateway.query.*
- Configure event publishing and consuming

### Phase 6: Integration Testing (1 hour)
**All Services**
- Start complete system with docker-compose
- Verify all health endpoints respond
- Confirm metrics collection in Prometheus
- Test database migrations
- Validate Kafka event flow
- Check GraphQL federation end-to-end

## Success Criteria

- [x] All 12 services (7 infrastructure + 5 core) have health endpoints
- [x] All 12 services expose Prometheus metrics

## Context Manifest

### How Production Infrastructure Currently Works in Infrastructure Services

The production infrastructure system follows a comprehensive observability and health monitoring pattern that has been successfully implemented across all 7 infrastructure services (audit, notification, file-storage, document-generator, scheduler, configuration, import-export). When a service starts in production, the following initialization sequence occurs:

**Service Bootstrap Flow:**
1. **Health Monitoring System**: Each service exposes three critical health endpoints through a standardized health controller pattern (copied from `services/audit/src/health/health.controller.ts`). The `/health` endpoint provides basic service status, `/health/live` serves as a Kubernetes liveness probe checking memory consumption, and `/health/ready` acts as a readiness probe that validates all external dependencies including database connectivity via simple SQL queries (`SELECT 1`), Elasticsearch health checks through service-specific health methods, and Kafka broker availability through configuration validation.

2. **Prometheus Metrics Collection**: The metrics system uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach with a centralized registry (`services/audit/src/modules/metrics/metrics.service.ts`). Each service registers both default Node.js metrics (CPU, memory, event loop) and service-specific business metrics. For example, the audit service tracks `audit_events_total` with labels for event_type, severity, outcome, and tenant_id, while HTTP request metrics are captured with method, route, and status_code dimensions. The metrics are exposed through a dedicated `/metrics` endpoint that returns Prometheus-formatted data with proper content-type headers.

3. **Database Migration System**: All infrastructure services use TypeORM migrations following a standardized pattern (`services/audit/src/migrations/20250924215853-AuditServiceInitial.ts`). Migrations create tables with UUID primary keys using `uuid_generate_v4()`, implement proper indexing strategies for performance, and include JSONB columns for flexible metadata storage. The migration system ensures zero-downtime deployments by creating indexes concurrently and handling backward compatibility.

4. **Kafka Event Integration**: Services integrate with Kafka through a shared service layer that publishes domain events for cross-service communication. The audit service publishes events like `audit.event.created` while maintaining event sourcing patterns. Topics follow naming conventions like `service.entity.action` (e.g., `audit.log.created`, `notification.message.sent`).

**Monitoring and Observability Flow:**
When Prometheus scrapes metrics from the `/metrics` endpoint every 15 seconds, it collects both system-level metrics (memory usage, CPU utilization, garbage collection) and business-level metrics (audit events processed, files stored, notifications sent). These metrics feed into Grafana dashboards that provide real-time visibility into system health. The health endpoints are configured in Kubernetes deployments as livenessProbe and readinessProbe, ensuring automatic service recovery and proper load balancer integration.

### For Core Services Implementation: What Needs to Connect

Since we're implementing production infrastructure for the 5 core business services (Auth, Master Data, Workflow, Rules Engine, API Gateway), these services need to integrate with the existing production monitoring ecosystem at specific architectural integration points:

**Authentication Service Integration Points:**
The Auth service already has health endpoints using @nestjs/terminus (`services/auth/src/modules/health/health.controller.ts`) but lacks the standardized format that matches infrastructure services. It needs to be converted to match the audit service pattern with proper dependency checking and statistics endpoints. The Auth service has partial metrics via telemetry (`services/auth/src/telemetry/metrics.service.ts`) but needs the standardized Prometheus metrics module that exports at `/metrics`. For database migrations, the Auth service has entities (User, Role, Permission, UserRole, EventStore) that require TypeORM migrations generated from these entities. The service has Kafka integration through `KafkaService` but needs proper topic creation for authentication events.

**Master Data Service Integration Points:**
The Master Data service has a basic health controller (`services/master-data/src/controllers/health.controller.ts`) with TODO comments for actual dependency checking - it returns hardcoded status responses instead of real health checks. It completely lacks metrics infrastructure and needs the full Prometheus metrics module. The service has entities (Customer, Vendor, Product, Account, Base) that need TypeORM migrations. It has Kafka configuration but needs topic creation for master data events like `master-data.customer.created`, `master-data.vendor.updated`.

**Workflow Service Integration Points:**
The Workflow service currently has no health endpoints, no metrics infrastructure, and no database migrations. It needs complete production infrastructure implementation following the infrastructure service patterns. It needs Kafka topics for workflow events like `workflow.process.started`, `workflow.task.assigned`, `workflow.process.completed`.

**Rules Engine Service Integration Points:**
The Rules Engine service lacks all production infrastructure components - no health endpoints, no metrics, no migrations, no Kafka integration. It needs complete implementation including topics for `rules.evaluation.requested`, `rules.rule.changed`, `rules.evaluation.completed`.

**API Gateway Integration Points:**
The API Gateway service needs health endpoints that check federation service availability, metrics for GraphQL query performance and federation response times, and Kafka integration for API usage events like `gateway.query.received`, `gateway.federation.error`.

### Technical Reference Details for Implementation

#### Component Interfaces & Signatures

**Health Controller Pattern (Copy from audit service):**
```typescript
@Controller('health')
export class HealthController {
  @Get() async health(): Promise<{status: string, service: string, timestamp: string}>
  @Get('live') async liveness(): Promise<{status: string, timestamp: string}>
  @Get('ready') async readiness(): Promise<{status: string, checks: object, timestamp: string}>
  @Get('stats') async stats(): Promise<{service: string, statistics: object, timestamp: string}>
  @Get('dependencies') async dependencies(): Promise<{service: string, dependencies: Array, timestamp: string}>
}
```

**Metrics Service Pattern (Adapt from audit service):**
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class MetricsService implements OnModuleInit {
  private register: client.Registry;
  private httpRequestDuration: client.Histogram;
  private httpRequestTotal: client.Counter;
  private [serviceSpecificMetrics]: client.Counter | client.Histogram | client.Gauge;

  async getMetrics(): Promise<string> // Returns Prometheus format
  recordHttpRequest(method: string, route: string, statusCode: number, duration: number): void
  [serviceSpecificMethods](): void
}
```

#### Data Structures & Migration Patterns

**Database Migration Template (Based on audit migration):**
```typescript
export class ServiceNameInitial implements MigrationInterface {
  public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {
    // Create tables with UUID primary keys
    await queryRunner.createTable(new Table({
      name: 'table_name',
      columns: [
        {name: 'id', type: 'uuid', isPrimary: true, default: 'uuid_generate_v4()'},
        {name: 'tenant_id', type: 'uuid'},
        // ... other columns
        {name: 'created_at', type: 'timestamp', default: 'now()'}
      ]
    }));

    // Create performance indexes
    await queryRunner.createIndex('table_name', new Index({name: 'IDX_table_tenant_id', columnNames: ['tenant_id']}));
  }
}
```

**Service-Specific Entity Requirements:**

**Auth Service Entities Requiring Migrations:**
- `users` table: id, email, password_hash, first_name, last_name, tenant_id, is_active, failed_login_attempts, locked_until, created_at, updated_at
- `roles` table: id, name, description, tenant_id, permissions, created_at, updated_at
- `permissions` table: id, name, description, resource, action, created_at
- `user_roles` table: id, user_id, role_id, granted_at, granted_by
- `refresh_tokens` table: id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at, revoked_at, created_at
- `event_store` table: id, aggregate_id, aggregate_type, event_type, event_data, version, created_at

**Master Data Service Entities Requiring Migrations:**
- `customers` table: id, code, name, email, phone, address, tenant_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at
- `vendors` table: id, code, name, tin, bin, email, phone, address, tenant_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at
- `products` table: id, sku, name, description, category, unit_of_measure, tenant_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at
- `accounts` table: id, code, name, account_type, parent_id, balance, tenant_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at

#### Configuration Requirements

**Prometheus Metrics Export Configuration:**
- All services need `/metrics` endpoint exposed on main port
- Prometheus scrape configuration in `infrastructure/docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml` needs updates for core services
- Grafana dashboard provisioning needs service-specific dashboards

**Kafka Topic Naming Conventions:**
- Auth Service: `auth.user.registered`, `auth.user.login`, `auth.token.refresh`, `auth.user.locked`
- Master Data: `master-data.customer.created`, `master-data.vendor.updated`, `master-data.product.created`, `master-data.account.created`
- Workflow: `workflow.process.started`, `workflow.task.created`, `workflow.task.completed`, `workflow.process.completed`
- Rules Engine: `rules.evaluation.requested`, `rules.rule.created`, `rules.rule.updated`, `rules.evaluation.completed`
- API Gateway: `gateway.query.received`, `gateway.query.completed`, `gateway.federation.error`, `gateway.mutation.received`

#### File Locations for Implementation

**Health Infrastructure:**
- Auth: Upgrade existing `services/auth/src/modules/health/health.controller.ts` to match audit pattern
- Master Data: Replace `services/master-data/src/controllers/health.controller.ts` with comprehensive version
- Workflow: Create `services/workflow/src/modules/health/` directory and files
- Rules Engine: Create `services/rules-engine/src/modules/health/` directory and files
- API Gateway: Create `services/api-gateway/src/modules/health/` directory and files

**Metrics Infrastructure:**
- All services need: `src/modules/metrics/metrics.module.ts`, `src/modules/metrics/metrics.controller.ts`, `src/modules/metrics/metrics.service.ts`
- Integration into main app modules: Import MetricsModule in each service's app.module.ts

**Database Migrations:**
- Auth: Create in `services/auth/src/migrations/` (directory exists, needs migration files)
- Master Data: Create in `services/master-data/src/migrations/` (needs initial migrations for existing entities)
- Workflow: Create `services/workflow/src/migrations/` directory and initial migration
- Rules Engine: Create `services/rules-engine/src/migrations/` directory and initial migration
- API Gateway: No database migrations needed (stateless service)

**Automation Scripts to Create/Modify:**
1. `scripts/add-metrics-to-core-services.sh` - Extend existing `setup-metrics-modules.sh` for core services
2. `scripts/generate-core-migrations.sh` - Extend existing `generate-migrations.sh` for core services
3. `scripts/upgrade-core-health-checks.sh` - Update existing health endpoints to production standard
4. `scripts/create-core-kafka-topics.sh` - Extend existing `create-kafka-topics.sh` for core service topics
5. `scripts/validate-complete-production-system.sh` - Comprehensive end-to-end validation

#### Success Validation Criteria

**Individual Service Health Validation:**
Each service must respond to `curl http://localhost:PORT/health` with `{"status": "ok", "service": "service-name", "timestamp": "ISO-8601"}`. The `/health/ready` endpoint must return detailed dependency checks with actual connectivity verification (not hardcoded responses). The `/health/live` endpoint must validate service liveness with memory threshold checks.

**Metrics Validation:**
Each service must export Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` endpoint with proper `Content-Type: text/plain` header. Metrics must include default Node.js metrics plus service-specific business metrics with appropriate labels. Prometheus must successfully scrape all 12 services (7 infrastructure + 5 core) without errors.

**Database Integration Validation:**
All services with persistence must have migrations that run successfully without conflicts. Database connections must be validated in health checks with actual query execution. Multi-tenant data isolation must be preserved in all entity tables.

**Event-Driven Architecture Validation:**
Kafka topics must be created for all core services following naming conventions. Services must successfully publish and consume events without message loss. Event schemas must be consistent across service boundaries.

**End-to-End System Validation:**
Complete system startup with `docker-compose up` must result in all 12 services showing healthy status. GraphQL federation must work through API Gateway with backend services providing data. Authentication flow must work from login through API Gateway to Master Data operations. All metrics must be visible in Grafana dashboards with no missing data points.

## Notes

- Use infrastructure services as templates (they're working correctly)
- Follow the same patterns for consistency
- Test each service individually before system integration
- Document any deviations from standard patterns

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Database Migration Conflicts**: Test migrations in isolated database first
2. **Service Dependencies**: Start services in correct order (database ‚Üí core ‚Üí infrastructure ‚Üí gateway)
3. **Kafka Topic Conflicts**: Use clear naming conventions to avoid collisions
4. **Metrics Cardinality**: Limit labels to prevent explosion

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All core services production-ready
- [ ] Complete system starts with `docker-compose up`
- [ ] All health checks passing
- [ ] All metrics visible in Grafana
- [ ] No errors in service logs
- [ ] Can perform end-to-end business operations
- [ ] Documentation updated
