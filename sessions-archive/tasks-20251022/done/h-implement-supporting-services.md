## Context Manifest
<!-- Will be populated by context-gathering agent -->

### Technology Stack

#### Notification Service
**Email**: 
- SendGrid (free tier: 100 emails/day)
- Fallback: SMTP with Gmail

**SMS (Bangladesh)**:
- Primary: Alpha SMS Gateway
- Backup: SMS.NET.BD
- Cost: ~0.30 BDT per SMS

**Push Notifications**:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (free)
- Web Push API for browsers

#### File Storage: MinIO
**Rationale**:
- 100% S3 API compatible
- Self-hosted (no cloud costs)
- Kubernetes native
- Open source (AGPLv3)

**Setup**:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
minio:
  image: minio/minio:latest
  ports:
    - "9000:9000"
    - "9001:9001"
  environment:
    MINIO_ROOT_USER: vextrus_admin
    MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: vextrus_minio_2024
  volumes:
    - minio_data:/data
  command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
```

#### Audit Service Architecture
- Event-driven audit logging
- PostgreSQL for storage
- Kafka for event streaming
- Retention policies (90 days default)

      api_key: process.env.ALPHA_SMS_API_KEY,
      to: this.formatBangladeshNumber(phone),
      message: message,
      sender_id: 'VEXTRUS'
    };
    
    await axios.post(`${this.API_URL}/send`, params);
  }

### Discovered During Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-09 / Supporting Services Foundation]

During actual implementation, several important discoveries were made that weren't captured in the original context:

**Bull Queue Integration Requirements**: The Notification Service required deeper integration with Bull queues than originally documented. We discovered that bulk notification processing needed dedicated queue processors (NotificationProcessor and BulkProcessor) to handle async processing efficiently. The original context didn't specify the need for separate queue processors with detailed job handling.

**Bangladesh SMS Integration Complexity**: The integration with Bangladesh SMS providers (Alpha SMS and SMS.NET.BD) revealed additional requirements for Unicode Bengali text handling, SMS segment calculation, and cost tracking that weren't documented in the original specs. The actual implementation required automatic detection of Bengali characters and special handling for Unicode messages.

**Multi-Channel Architecture Pattern**: During implementation, we discovered that each notification channel (Email, SMS, Push) needed dedicated channel classes with provider fallback logic. The original context showed simple service methods but the actual architecture required sophisticated channel abstraction with provider switching capabilities.

**Configuration Service Feature Flag System**: The Configuration Service implementation revealed the need for complex feature flag evaluation with tenant/user-specific rules, Redis caching, and dynamic configuration updates. The original context didn't detail the sophisticated rule engine required for multi-tenant feature flag management.

**Port Allocation Strategy**: During implementation, we established a systematic port allocation strategy (3003-3009) for all supporting services that wasn't documented in the original context. This became crucial for service discovery and load balancing configuration.

**Docker Compose Production Requirements**: The actual Docker infrastructure setup required much more comprehensive service definitions than originally documented, including Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Consul, and sophisticated networking configuration for production readiness.

**Service Structure Pattern**: We discovered that each service needs a consistent directory structure with specific modules (controllers, services, DTOs, entities, channels/providers, queues, health) that wasn't fully detailed in the original planning.

[Date: 2025-09-10 / RBAC System Implementation]

During RBAC system implementation, significant architectural and business domain discoveries were made that exceeded the original scope:

**Hierarchical Permission Inheritance Complexity**: The Bangladesh Construction/Real Estate context revealed the need for sophisticated role hierarchy with multi-level inheritance (5 levels deep). The actual implementation required complex algorithms for permission resolution, parent role traversal, and scope-based restrictions that weren't documented in the original planning. The inheritance model needed to handle cases where child roles override parent permissions and temporal assignments affect inheritance chains.

**Bangladesh-Specific Compliance Integration**: The real-world integration with Bangladesh regulatory requirements (RAJUK, NBR) was far more complex than originally anticipated. We discovered specific permission patterns for construction approval workflows, tax filing procedures, and compliance reporting that required dedicated permission categories and specialized checking logic. The system needed to handle multi-stage approval processes with role-based delegation.

**Temporal Role Assignment Architecture**: During implementation, we found that construction projects require sophisticated time-bound role assignments with automatic expiration, delegation workflows, and temporary permission elevation. The original context didn't capture the complexity of managing contractor permissions during specific project phases or handling seasonal worker access patterns common in Bangladesh construction.

**Bengali Localization Requirements**: The implementation revealed extensive localization needs beyond simple translations. Role names, permission descriptions, and error messages needed contextual Bengali translations that align with Bangladesh business terminology. We also discovered the need for bidirectional text handling in API responses and role management interfaces.

**Multi-Tenant Role Isolation**: The actual implementation required more sophisticated tenant isolation than originally planned. We discovered that construction companies need project-specific roles, site-based permissions, and cross-tenant contractor access patterns that required complex scope restriction algorithms and permission boundary enforcement.

**JWT Token Enhancement Integration**: Integrating RBAC with the existing JWT authentication system revealed the need for token payload optimization, permission claim encoding, and distributed permission checking across microservices. The original context didn't specify the token structure changes needed to support efficient permission resolution without database lookups.

**Database Schema Evolution**: The RBAC implementation required more complex database relationships than originally planned, including role_permissions junction tables, user_roles with temporal columns, and permission condition storage for dynamic access control. The migration strategy needed to handle existing user data and role assignments.

#### Updated Technical Details
- **Permission Inheritance Algorithm**: Recursive role traversal with scope-based filtering and override handling
- **Temporal Assignment System**: Automatic expiration jobs, delegation workflows, and emergency access procedures
- **Bengali Localization Engine**: Contextual translation system with business domain terminology
- **Multi-Tenant Scope Resolution**: Project-based permissions, site restrictions, and cross-tenant contractor access
- **JWT Permission Claims**: Optimized token structure with permission hierarchy encoding
- **Role Migration System**: Complex data migration with role mapping and permission preservation
- **Compliance Permission Categories**: RAJUK approval workflows, NBR filing permissions, safety compliance checks
- **Dynamic Permission Conditions**: JSON-based condition evaluation for context-aware access control
