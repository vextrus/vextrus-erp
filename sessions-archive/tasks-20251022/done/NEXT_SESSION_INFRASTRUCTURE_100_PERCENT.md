# NEXT SESSION: Achieve 100% Infrastructure Readiness

## Session Context
**Current Task**: h-fix-infrastructure-achieve-100-percent-readiness
**Current Progress**: 40% Complete (4/13 services operational)
**Branch**: feature/h-fix-infrastructure-achieve-100-percent-readiness
**Last Checkpoint**: .claude/state/checkpoint-2025-09-25-infrastructure-40-percent.md

## START WITH THIS PROMPT:

```
I need to achieve 100% infrastructure readiness for the Vextrus ERP system. Currently at 40% with 4/13 services operational.

PHASE 1: DEEP EXPLORATION AND ANALYSIS (pmode explore)
First, set exploration mode: pmode explore

Then perform comprehensive analysis:

1. Use Context7 to analyze our Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure:
   - Search for all Dockerfile patterns in infrastructure/docker/
   - Find all kubernetes manifests in infrastructure/kubernetes/
   - Identify misalignments with current service implementations

2. Use Consult7 to analyze service health implementations:
   - Analyze health endpoint patterns across all services
   - Check services/**/health.controller.ts and services/**/health.module.ts
   - Identify which services have health endpoints vs which are missing

3. Use Sequential Thinking to analyze the remaining 60% gap:
   - What are the exact issues with the 8 untested services?
   - Why is Configuration Service in a restart loop?
   - What security vulnerabilities remain unaddressed?
   - What business logic TODOs are blocking production readiness?

4. Check current infrastructure status:
   docker-compose ps --format "table {{.Service}}\t{{.Status}}"

5. Test all service endpoints systematically:
   # Health endpoints
   for port in 3001 3002 3003 3004 3005 3006 3007 3008 3009 3010 3011 3012 3013 3014 3015 3016; do
     echo "Port $port health: $(curl -s http://localhost:$port/api/v1/health 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"status"' || echo 'No response')"
   done

PHASE 2: CREATE EXECUTION PLAN
Based on the analysis, create a phase-wise execution plan:

Phase A: Service Recovery (40% → 70%)
- Priority 1: Fix Configuration Service GraphQL properly
- Priority 2: Test and fix 8 unknown services
- Priority 3: Standardize health endpoints

Phase B: Security Hardening (70% → 85%)
- Enable HTTPS with Traefik
- Move secrets to environment files
- Implement rate limiting

Phase C: Business Logic (85% → 95%)
- Complete Import-Export service TODOs
- Add missing error handlers
- Implement circuit breakers

Phase D: Final Validation (95% → 100%)
- Run integration tests
- Establish performance baselines
- Document all changes

PHASE 3: SYSTEMATIC EXECUTION (pmode implement)
Switch to implementation mode and execute the plan phase by phase.

KEY CONTEXT FROM LAST SESSION:
- API Gateway SKIP_SERVICES parsing fixed (trim and filter empty strings)
- Port alignments: import-export(3007), project-management(3017), scm(3018)
- Configuration Service GraphQL temporarily disabled (needs proper fix)
- Workflow Service duplicate imports removed
- Docker builds require 10+ minute timeouts
- Health endpoints inconsistent (/health vs /api/v1/health)
- Many services don't need GraphQL federation (REST-only)

WORKING SERVICES:
✅ Auth (3001) - 100% healthy
✅ Master Data (3002) - Basic health working
✅ API Gateway (4000) - GraphQL federation operational
✅ Workflow (3011) - Temporal connected

PROBLEM SERVICES:
⚠️ Configuration (3004) - Restart loop, GraphQL disabled
❓ 8 services untested - Need systematic verification

## Critical Files to Review

### Infrastructure Files
- infrastructure/docker/services/*.Dockerfile
- infrastructure/kubernetes/**/*.yaml
- docker-compose.yml
- docker-compose.monitoring.yml

### Service Configurations
- services/*/src/main.ts (for health setup)
- services/*/src/modules/health/*.ts
- services/*/src/app.module.ts (for module imports)
- services/*/src/config/configuration.ts

### Documentation
- sessions/tasks/h-fix-infrastructure-achieve-100-percent-readiness.md
- .claude/state/checkpoint-2025-09-25-infrastructure-40-percent.md
- INFRASTRUCTURE_STATUS.md

## Success Metrics
1. All 13 services showing "healthy" status
2. Zero restart loops or crashes
3. GraphQL federation fully operational
4. All health endpoints standardized
5. Security vulnerabilities addressed
6. Integration tests passing
7. Performance baselines established

## Time Allocation
- Phase 1 (Analysis): 30 minutes
- Phase 2 (Planning): 15 minutes
- Phase 3 (Execution): 4-6 hours
- Validation: 30 minutes

## Deliverables
1. 100% infrastructure readiness
2. Updated checkpoint documentation
3. Fixed and tested all 13 services
4. Security hardening implemented
5. Comprehensive test results
6. Final infrastructure report
