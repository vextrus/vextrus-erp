## Context Manifest

### Discovered During Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-16 / Infrastructure Resolution Session]

During implementation, we discovered several critical infrastructure behaviors that weren't documented in the original context. These weren't obvious from reading configuration files but became apparent during actual deployment and testing.

**PostgreSQL Database Initialization Behavior**: PostgreSQL's init.sql script only executes when the POSTGRES_DB environment variable is NOT specified in docker-compose.yml. If POSTGRES_DB is set, PostgreSQL creates only that single database and ignores initialization scripts. This caused a major blocker where services couldn't connect because their expected databases (vextrus_auth, vextrus_workflow, etc.) weren't being created. The solution required removing POSTGRES_DB from docker-compose.yml and relying entirely on the init.sql script to create all 17 required databases.

**GraphQL Federation Schema Requirements**: GraphQL Federation with Apollo requires explicit @key directives on all entities that will be part of the distributed schema. Simply having GraphQL resolvers isn't sufficient - entities need `@Directive('@key(fields: "id")')` decorators for the API Gateway to compose subgraphs. Without these directives, federation fails silently during schema introspection, leaving services appearing as "unable to load definitions."

**Environment Variable Naming Critical Pattern**: The infrastructure is extremely sensitive to environment variable naming patterns. All database-related variables MUST use the DATABASE_* prefix consistently across all services. Mixed usage of DB_* and DATABASE_* patterns causes connection failures because some services expect one pattern while configuration provides another. This affects DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_PORT, DATABASE_USERNAME, DATABASE_PASSWORD, and DATABASE_NAME.

**Docker Compose File Proliferation Problem**: Over time, multiple docker-compose files accumulate for different deployment scenarios, creating confusion and conflicts. The project had accumulated docker-compose-without-temporal.yml, docker-compose.test.yml, docker-compose.prod.yml, and several others, each with slightly different configurations. This leads to deployment inconsistencies and makes troubleshooting difficult. The most maintainable approach is keeping only docker-compose.yml (base) and docker-compose.override.yml (development-specific).

#### Updated Technical Details
- Database initialization requires removing POSTGRES_DB from docker-compose.yml environment
- All GraphQL entities need @Directive('@key(fields: "id")') for federation compatibility
- Environment variables must follow DATABASE_* pattern consistently across all services
- Docker Compose should follow the standard pattern: base file + single override for environment-specific changes
- Service startup failures often indicate missing databases rather than application code issues

### Additional Discoveries - GraphQL Federation Implementation
[Date: 2025-09-16 / GraphQL Implementation Session]

During the comprehensive GraphQL federation implementation across all services, we discovered several critical patterns and constraints that weren't apparent from the original architectural planning phase. These discoveries significantly impact how GraphQL federation must be implemented in practice.

**GraphQL Entity Type Safety Requirements**: GraphQL federation with Apollo requires strict separation between database entities and GraphQL response types. Database entities cannot be directly exposed through GraphQL resolvers because they contain fields that should not be part of the public API schema (like `passwordHash`, internal flags, etc.). Each service must create separate Response DTOs that include only the fields intended for GraphQL exposure. For example, the auth service required a `UserResponse` DTO separate from the `User` entity to prevent sensitive fields from being exposed in the GraphQL schema.

**Service Method Parameter Wrapping Pattern**: GraphQL resolver methods must exactly match the parameter patterns expected by the underlying service methods. This often requires parameter transformation in the resolver layer. For instance, the auth service's `refreshToken` method expects a `RefreshTokenDto` object, but the GraphQL mutation receives a simple string input, requiring the resolver to wrap it: `this.authService.refreshToken({ refreshToken: input.refreshToken })` instead of passing the string directly.

**Apollo GraphQL Module Configuration Complexity**: Each service requires sophisticated Apollo GraphQL module configuration that goes beyond basic schema generation. The configuration must include: tenant context propagation through headers, conditional playground enablement based on environment, federation directive support in schema building options, and automatic schema file generation with sorting. This configuration is critical for multi-tenant federation and differs significantly from single-service GraphQL setups.

**Federation Service Startup Order Dependencies**: GraphQL federation creates hard dependencies between services that don't exist in pure REST architectures. The API Gateway cannot successfully start and compose the federated schema until ALL subgraph services are running and have their GraphQL endpoints available. This means services must start in a specific order: core infrastructure → individual services → API Gateway. Failed or slow-starting services cause federation schema composition failures that propagate to the entire system.

**GraphQL Federation vs REST Endpoint Coexistence**: Successfully implementing GraphQL federation doesn't require removing existing REST endpoints. Services can (and should) maintain both REST controllers and GraphQL resolvers, providing maximum client flexibility. This hybrid approach allows gradual migration and supports different client needs - mobile apps might prefer GraphQL while internal services might continue using REST APIs.

#### Updated Implementation Patterns
- GraphQL Response DTOs must be created separately from database entities for clean API boundaries
- Service method calls in GraphQL resolvers require parameter transformation to match expected signatures
- Apollo GraphQL module configuration requires tenant context, federation directives, and environment-specific settings
- Federation deployment requires coordinated service startup with proper health checking
- Hybrid REST/GraphQL architecture provides maximum flexibility and migration safety

### How the Current Infrastructure Works: Microservices Architecture with Mixed API Patterns

The current Vextrus ERP infrastructure follows a microservices architecture using Docker Compose for orchestration and Traefik as an API gateway/load balancer. The system consists of approximately 15 services that handle different business domains, but there are significant architectural mismatches that create deployment and integration issues.

**Service Discovery and Communication Flow:**
When a request enters the system, it first hits Traefik (running on port 80/443) which routes traffic based on Host headers and path prefixes. Traefik discovers services automatically through Docker labels and forwards requests to the appropriate service containers. However, the current setup has a critical flaw: the API Gateway service expects GraphQL federation endpoints from all services, but most services only expose REST endpoints.

The API Gateway (port 4000) is configured as an Apollo Federation Gateway that tries to introspect and compose subgraphs from multiple services. It expects GraphQL endpoints at paths like `/graphql` from services like auth, master-data, workflow, and rules-engine. However, examination of the service implementations reveals that only master-data actually implements GraphQL resolvers - the auth service only provides REST endpoints through controllers.

**Database and State Management:**
All services connect to a shared PostgreSQL instance (port 5432) with individual databases per service (vextrus_auth, vextrus_master_data, etc.). The database setup includes sophisticated multi-tenancy with Row-Level Security (RLS) policies that filter data based on tenant_id session variables. Redis (port 6379) provides caching and session storage across services. The database migrations show a well-planned tenant isolation strategy using organizations, divisions, projects, and sites hierarchy.

**Event Streaming and Workflow Orchestration:**
Kafka (port 9093) handles event streaming between services for eventual consistency and business event propagation. However, the Temporal workflow engine - critical for approval workflows and business process orchestration - is defined in docker-compose.yml but services are configured to expect it without fallback mechanisms. The workflow service has a TEMPORAL_ENABLED flag but the connection logic may fail if Temporal is unavailable.

**Observability and Monitoring:**
The system implements comprehensive observability through SigNoz (ports 3301, 4317, 4318) with OpenTelemetry instrumentation in services like auth and master-data. ClickHouse serves as the metrics storage backend. However, the tracing configuration appears inconsistent across services - some have complete OTEL setup while others may lack proper instrumentation.

### Configuration Management Architecture Issues

The current configuration management suffers from several consistency problems that prevent reliable deployments:

**Environment Variable Inconsistencies:**
Services use different patterns for database credentials. The auth service expects individual variables (DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_PORT, DATABASE_USERNAME) while other services might use different naming conventions. Some services use DATABASE_USER instead of DATABASE_USERNAME, creating credential mismatches during container startup.

**Port Management Conflicts:**
The docker-compose.yml exposes multiple services on similar ports, and some services have hardcoded port references that don't match the actual container network topology. The API Gateway configuration assumes services are available at specific ports that may not align with the actual service deployment.

**Multi-Environment Configuration:**
The system has docker-compose.override.yml for development-specific settings and docker-compose-without-temporal.yml as a fallback, but these configurations diverge in ways that make production deployment complex. The .env.example shows Bangladesh-specific integrations (RAJUK_API_KEY, NBR_API_KEY, BKASH_APP_KEY) but these aren't consistently referenced across service configurations.

### For Infrastructure Research Implementation: Architecture Decision Points

Since we're implementing a comprehensive infrastructure solution, several critical architectural decisions must be made that will affect every subsequent development:

**GraphQL Federation vs REST Aggregation vs Hybrid Approach:**
The current API Gateway assumes full GraphQL federation, but most services provide REST APIs. We need to decide whether to: (1) Convert all services to GraphQL with federation, (2) Replace federation with REST aggregation patterns, or (3) Implement a hybrid gateway that can proxy both REST and GraphQL endpoints. Each approach has implications for client integration, schema management, and service autonomy.

**Temporal Deployment Strategy:**
The workflow orchestration depends on Temporal but the deployment strategy is unclear. We need to determine whether to use managed Temporal Cloud, self-hosted Temporal with proper clustering, or implement fallback patterns using Redis-based job queues. This decision affects how approval workflows, business processes, and distributed transactions will function.

**Service Communication Patterns:**
The current setup mixes synchronous HTTP calls (for queries) with asynchronous Kafka events (for commands), but the boundaries aren't clearly defined. We need to establish patterns for: service-to-service authentication, circuit breaking for resilience, timeout and retry policies, and distributed tracing correlation.

**Configuration and Secrets Management:**
The current approach uses Docker environment variables, but this doesn't scale to production. We need to implement proper configuration management with: hierarchical configuration (default -> environment -> service-specific), secrets management integration, hot-reloading capabilities for feature flags, and tenant-specific configuration overrides.

**Development vs Production Environment Strategy:**
The current docker-compose setup works for development but lacks production-grade concerns. We need to design: blue-green deployment strategies, rolling update patterns, health checking and graceful shutdown, resource limits and autoscaling policies, and disaster recovery procedures.

### Technical Reference Details

#### Current Service Architecture Patterns

**Authentication Flow:**
- Auth service (port 3001) provides JWT-based authentication via REST endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/register, /auth/refresh)
- Uses CQRS pattern with CommandBus and QueryBus for separation of concerns
- Integrates with Redis for session storage and PostgreSQL for user persistence
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation configured for distributed tracing

**Master Data Service:**
- Exposes both REST controllers and GraphQL resolvers for customer, vendor, product, and account entities
- Implements tenant isolation through TypeORM with RLS policies
- Uses caching layer through Redis for performance optimization
- Kafka integration for domain event publishing

**API Gateway Service:**
- Apollo Federation Gateway expecting GraphQL subgraphs from all services
- Automatic service discovery through configuration with polling intervals
- Context propagation for authentication tokens and tenant headers
- CORS and security configuration for client applications

#### Database Configuration Patterns

**Multi-Tenant Setup:**
```sql
-- Row-Level Security with tenant context
CREATE FUNCTION get_current_tenant_id() RETURNS UUID
-- Tenant isolation policies for all business entities
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_select ON projects FOR SELECT USING (tenant_id = get_current_tenant_id())
```

**Connection Patterns:**
- Shared PostgreSQL with individual databases per service
- TypeORM with entity synchronization in development
- Migration-based schema management for production

#### Infrastructure Component Dependencies

**Service Startup Order:**
1. Core Infrastructure: PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Zookeeper
2. External Services: Temporal, SigNoz components
3. Platform Services: Auth, Configuration, Notification
4. Business Services: Master-data, Workflow, Rules-engine
5. Gateway Services: API Gateway, Traefik

**Network Communication:**
- Docker bridge network (vextrus-network) for internal communication
- Traefik reverse proxy for external access
- Service mesh considerations for production deployment

#### Configuration Management Requirements

**Environment-Specific Variables:**
```bash
# Database connectivity
DATABASE_HOST=postgres
DATABASE_USERNAME=vextrus  # vs DATABASE_USER inconsistency
DATABASE_PASSWORD=vextrus_dev_2024

# Service discovery
MASTER_DATA_URL=http://master-data:3002/graphql  # GraphQL assumption
AUTH_URL=http://auth:3001/graphql               # But auth only has REST

# Bangladesh-specific integrations
RAJUK_API_KEY=
NBR_API_KEY=
BKASH_APP_KEY=
```

#### Known Issues and Blockers

**Critical Path Blockers:**
1. API Gateway cannot load service definitions because services don't expose GraphQL schemas
2. Temporal server dependency prevents workflow service startup in some environments
3. Inconsistent database credential patterns cause connection failures
4. Port conflicts between development and container networking

**Configuration Inconsistencies:**
1. Services mix DATABASE_USER vs DATABASE_USERNAME
2. Some services expect different Redis database numbers
3. Kafka broker addresses vary between internal and external access
4. OpenTelemetry endpoint configuration not standardized
