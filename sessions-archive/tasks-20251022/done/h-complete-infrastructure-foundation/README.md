# Complete Infrastructure Foundation - Production Readiness

## Problem/Goal
Build and run all services in Docker containers with full infrastructure configuration, monitoring, observability, and documentation to achieve production readiness. This is the final infrastructure task before beginning business module and frontend development. All services must be containerized, health-checked, monitored via Grafana, with complete API documentation.

## Success Criteria
### Service Containerization
- [ ] All 20+ services built as Docker containers
- [ ] All services running with proper health checks
- [ ] Docker Compose orchestration fully functional
- [ ] Inter-service communication verified
- [ ] Database schemas initialized for all services

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Prometheus collecting metrics from all services
- [ ] All services exposing /metrics endpoints
- [ ] Grafana dashboards showing real data for all services
- [ ] Health endpoints (/health, /ready, /live) functional
- [ ] OpenTelemetry tracing operational
- [ ] Log aggregation with proper levels

### API & Documentation
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI docs for all REST endpoints
- [ ] GraphQL playground for Federation Gateway
- [ ] API documentation accessible at /api-docs
- [ ] Service dependency map documented
- [ ] Architecture diagrams updated

### Infrastructure Components
- [ ] PostgreSQL with all schemas created
- [ ] Redis cluster operational
- [ ] Kafka with all topics created
- [ ] MinIO object storage configured
- [ ] Temporal workflow engine running
- [ ] Traefik routing all services

### Security & Performance
- [ ] JWT authentication working across services
- [ ] RBAC permissions validated
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates (dev)
- [ ] Performance baselines established

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Docker Build Issues
1. Update all Dockerfiles to working versions
2. Resolve pnpm workspace dependencies
3. Fix build context and paths
4. Create optimized multi-stage builds

### Phase 2: Service Initialization
1. Start infrastructure services first (DB, Redis, Kafka)
2. Initialize database schemas
3. Start core services (Auth, Master Data)
4. Start dependent services
5. Verify health checks

### Phase 3: Monitoring Integration
1. Add metrics endpoints to all services
2. Configure Prometheus scraping
3. Create comprehensive Grafana dashboards
4. Set up alerting rules
5. Test observability pipeline

### Phase 4: API Documentation
1. Configure Swagger for REST services
2. Set up GraphQL playground
3. Generate API documentation
4. Create integration examples
5. Document authentication flow

### Phase 5: Validation & Testing
1. Run health check suite
2. Verify inter-service communication
3. Test authentication flow
4. Validate monitoring data
5. Performance baseline tests

## Context
- Previous research completed in h-research-and-planning-phase
- Frontend architecture documented
- Finance module specification ready
- Basic monitoring infrastructure exists
- Some services partially containerized

## Dependencies
- Docker Desktop running
- Sufficient system resources (16GB RAM minimum)
- All service code present in services/
- Infrastructure configuration in infrastructure/

## Risk Mitigation
- Create docker-compose.override.yml for local customization
- Use health check retries to handle slow starts
- Document troubleshooting steps
- Create rollback procedures
- Monitor resource usage

## Definition of Done
- All services running in Docker with green health checks
- Grafana showing real metrics for every service
- API documentation accessible and complete
- Zero errors in service logs
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- Team can start frontend/business module development immediately

## Estimated Effort
- Total: 3-5 days
- Phase 1: 1 day (Docker fixes)
- Phase 2: 1 day (Service initialization)
- Phase 3: 1 day (Monitoring)
- Phase 4: 0.5 days (Documentation)
- Phase 5: 0.5 days (Validation)

## Notes
- This is the gateway to production readiness
- After completion, infrastructure changes should be minimal
- Sets foundation for CI/CD pipeline
- Enables parallel frontend and backend development
