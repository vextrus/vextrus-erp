# Compounding Cycle Example: Invoice Payment

**Feature**: Invoice payment processing with event sourcing
**Complexity**: Medium (6-8 hours total)
**Result**: 5.25 hours (vs 8+ hours sequential)

---

## PLAN PHASE (1.5 hours)

### Context Gathering (30 min)
```bash
/explore services/finance  # Haiku 4.5
cat services/finance/CLAUDE.md
```

### Architecture Design (1 hour)
**Agents deployed (parallel)**:
- architecture-strategist → Payment aggregate design
- pattern-recognition-specialist → Identify existing patterns
- best-practices-researcher → Payment processing best practices

**Output**: `sessions/specs/invoice-payment-processing.md` (150 lines)

---

## DELEGATE PHASE (1.5 hours parallel)

### Subtasks (TodoWrite)
1. Payment aggregate (domain)
2. Payment domain events
3. Command handlers (application)
4. Event store repository
5. Read model projections
6. GraphQL mutations/queries
7. Unit tests
8. Integration tests

### Parallel Execution (5 Haiku agents)
- **Haiku 1**: Domain layer (aggregate, events, business rules)
- **Haiku 2**: Application layer (commands, queries)
- **Haiku 3**: Infrastructure (repository, projections, migrations)
- **Haiku 4**: GraphQL layer (types, mutations, resolvers)
- **Haiku 5**: Testing (unit + integration tests)

**Time saved**: Sequential ~4 hours → Parallel ~1.5 hours (2.67x faster)

---

## ASSESS PHASE (1.5 hours)

### Level 1: Automated (15 min)
```bash
/review /security-scan /test
pnpm build
```
All gates passed ✅

### Level 2: Language-Specific (30 min)
- kieran-typescript-reviewer → Naming improvements applied

### Level 3: Specialized (45 min)
- performance-oracle → Added caching for customer lookups
- security-sentinel → Added rate limiting
- data-integrity-guardian → Verified idempotency keys

---

## CODIFY PHASE (45 min)

### Learning Capture (feedback-codifier)
**Patterns that worked**:
- Event sourcing for payment state
- Parallel Haiku execution
- Value objects for validation
- Idempotency keys

**To simplify**:
- Extract error handling boilerplate
- Create resolver base class
- Create payment test factory

**To automate**:
- Event sourcing boilerplate
- GraphQL CRUD generation

### Knowledge Base Updates
1. `services/finance/CLAUDE.md` - Payment patterns
2. `sessions/knowledge/vextrus-erp/patterns/payment-processing.md` (new)
3. `sessions/knowledge/vextrus-erp/patterns/event-sourcing-boilerplate.md` (new)

---

## Results

**Time**: 5.25 hours (vs 8+ sequential)
**Quality**: 94% test coverage, 250ms performance, all gates passed
**Compounding**: Next payment feature 40% faster (3 hours vs 5)

---

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Reference implementation for medium complexity features
