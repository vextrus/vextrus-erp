# Feature: Backend Production Readiness Validation (100% Certification)

**SpecKit Feature Specification** - Final validation before frontend development

---

## 1. Context & Research

### Problem Statement

After months of backend development, the Finance service represents our first complete business module. Before proceeding with frontend development, we need **absolute certainty** that:

1. All backend services are production-ready with zero critical issues
2. Finance service business logic is 100% complete and tested
3. No technical debt remains that could impact frontend development
4. All infrastructure, integration, and quality standards are met
5. System can handle production load and edge cases

**Critical Context**:
- Finance is the first business module (HR, CRM, SCM, Project Management follow later)
- Frontend development cannot proceed until backend stability is certified
- This is the final checkpoint before actual production deployment
- Any issues discovered here must be resolved completely

### Background Research

**Current Backend State**:
```bash
# 18 Microservices:
Production (11): auth, master-data, notification, configuration, scheduler,
                 document-generator, import-export, file-storage, audit,
                 workflow, rules-engine, organization

In Progress (7): finance, crm, hr, project-management, scm, inventory, reporting

# Technology Stack:
- NestJS 11 (all services)
- GraphQL Federation (Apollo Server v4)
- PostgreSQL 16+ (persistence)
- EventStoreDB (event sourcing)
- Apache Kafka (async messaging)
- Docker Compose (orchestration)
```

**What We've Built (Finance Service)**:
- Complete domain model (aggregates, entities, value objects)
- Event sourcing with EventStore
- GraphQL Federation integration
- Command/Query handlers (CQRS)
- Business rules and validation
- Integration with Master Data and Notification services

**Known Issues to Address**:
- Potential GraphQL Federation schema conflicts
- Event replay and consistency validation needed
- Performance under load not fully tested
- Security audit incomplete
- Documentation gaps
- Technical debt from rapid development

## 3. Technical Approach & Decisions

### Architecture Decision

**Pattern**: Comprehensive multi-phase validation using specialized agents

**Rationale**:
- Complex system requiring multiple validation approaches
- Different aspects (performance, security, data) need specialized expertise
- Cannot rely on single validation method
- Need objective, automated measurements where possible

**Phases**:
1. **Discovery**: Deep exploration of current state
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite execution
3. **Security**: Full security audit
4. **Performance**: Load testing and optimization
5. **Integration**: End-to-end workflow validation
6. **Documentation**: Completeness verification
7. **Certification**: Final sign-off checklist

### Phase 1: Discovery & Current State Assessment

**Objectives**:
- Understand exact current state of all services
- Identify all remaining issues and gaps
- Catalog technical debt
- Map service dependencies

**Approach**:
```bash
# Use Explore agent for comprehensive analysis
/explore services/finance
/explore services/master-data
/explore services/auth
/explore services/notification

# Use specialized agents
Task tool: compounding-engineering:pattern-recognition-specialist
Task tool: compounding-engineering:git-history-analyzer
Task tool: backend-development:backend-architect
```

**Deliverables**:
- Current state report (markdown)
- Issue catalog (categorized by severity)
- Technical debt inventory
- Dependency graph

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing

**Unit Tests**:

## 7. References

### Constitution Principles Applied

- **Plugin-first development**: Use all quality gate plugins
- **Compounding quality**: Each validation improves system
- **Context efficiency**: Reference service docs, don't embed
- **Zero technical debt**: Resolve all before frontend

### Service Documentation Consulted

- `services/finance/CLAUDE.md` - Finance service architecture
- `services/master-data/CLAUDE.md` - Master data integration
- `services/auth/CLAUDE.md` - Authentication patterns
- `services/notification/CLAUDE.md` - Notification integration

### Patterns Used

- **Compounding cycle**: Plan → Delegate → Assess → Codify
- **Multi-phase validation**: Discovery → Test → Secure → Optimize → Certify
- **Specialized agents**: Use 107 agents for expertise
