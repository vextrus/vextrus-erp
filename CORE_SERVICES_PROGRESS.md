# Core Services Production Infrastructure - Progress Report

## Summary
Successfully added production infrastructure components to 5 critical core business services that were missing essential production requirements.

## Completed Phases (3 of 6)

### ✅ Phase 1: Health Checks (COMPLETE)
**Services Updated**: master-data, workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway
- Created health modules with controllers for all services
- Added health endpoints: `/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`
- Integrated health checks for Database, Redis, and Kafka connections
- Updated all app.module.ts files to import HealthModule
- Auth service already had health checks

**Files Created**:
- `services/master-data/src/modules/health/*`
- `services/workflow/src/modules/health/*`
- `services/rules-engine/src/modules/health/*`
- `services/api-gateway/src/modules/health/*`
- `scripts/add-health-to-core-services.sh`
- `scripts/update-app-modules-health.sh`

### ✅ Phase 2: Prometheus Metrics (COMPLETE)
**Services Updated**: auth, master-data, workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway
- Created comprehensive metrics modules for all services
- Added service-specific business metrics:
  - **Auth**: Login attempts, token generation, session management, RBAC checks
  - **Master Data**: CRUD operations, query performance, cache hits, validation errors
  - **Workflow**: Process lifecycle, task assignments, SLA breaches, queue sizes
  - **Rules Engine**: Rule evaluations, condition checks, action executions, cache effectiveness
  - **API Gateway**: Federated queries, service calls, rate limiting, circuit breaker status
- Exposed `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format
- Updated all app.module.ts files to import MetricsModule

**Files Created**:
- `services/auth/src/modules/metrics/*`
- `services/master-data/src/modules/metrics/*`
- `services/workflow/src/modules/metrics/*`
- `services/rules-engine/src/modules/metrics/*`
- `services/api-gateway/src/modules/metrics/*`
- `scripts/setup-metrics-core-services.sh`
- `scripts/update-app-modules-metrics.sh`

### ✅ Phase 3: Database Migrations - Existing Services (COMPLETE)
**Services Updated**: auth, master-data
- Generated TypeORM migrations for existing entities
- **Auth Service Tables**:
  - users - User authentication data with Bangladesh-specific fields (NID, mobile format)
  - roles - RBAC role definitions
  - permissions - Resource-action permissions
  - user_roles - User-role associations
  - role_permissions - Role-permission mappings
  - refresh_tokens - JWT refresh token storage
  - sessions - Active user sessions
  - auth_event_store - Event sourcing for audit trail

- **Master Data Service Tables**:
  - customers - Customer records with TIN/BIN/NID validation
  - vendors - Vendor records with trade license support
  - products - Product catalog with HS codes and VAT rates (15% default)
  - chart_of_accounts - Financial accounts hierarchy
  - categories - Hierarchical categorization system
  - units - Units of measurement with Bengali support

**Files Created**:
- `services/auth/src/migrations/20250925005221-AuthServiceInitial.ts`
- `services/master-data/src/migrations/20250925005221-MasterDataServiceInitial.ts`
- `scripts/generate-core-migrations.sh`

## Remaining Phases (3 of 6)

### ⏳ Phase 4: Create Entities & Migrations for Workflow/Rules-Engine
**Services**: workflow, rules-engine
- Need to create entity files first
- Then generate migrations
- Estimated: 3 hours

### ⏳ Phase 5: Kafka Integration
**Services**: workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway
- Configure Kafka clients
- Create topics and event schemas
- Estimated: 1 hour

### ⏳ Phase 6: Integration Testing
**All Services**
- Docker-compose verification
- End-to-end testing
- Grafana dashboard validation
- Estimated: 1 hour

## Current Service Status Matrix

| Service | Health ✅ | Metrics ✅ | Migrations | Kafka | Ready |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------|-------|--------|
| **Auth** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Master-Data** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Workflow** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Rules-Engine** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **API-Gateway** | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | ❌ | ❌ |

## Scripts Created
1. `add-health-to-core-services.sh` - Adds health modules
2. `update-app-modules-health.sh` - Updates app.module for health
3. `setup-metrics-core-services.sh` - Adds metrics modules
4. `update-app-modules-metrics.sh` - Updates app.module for metrics
5. `generate-core-migrations.sh` - Creates database migrations

## Key Achievements
- ✅ All 5 core services now have health endpoints for Kubernetes
- ✅ All 5 core services expose Prometheus metrics
- ✅ Auth and Master-Data have complete database schemas
- ✅ Bangladesh-specific validations included (TIN, BIN, NID, VAT)
- ✅ Multi-tenant support with tenant_id in all tables
- ✅ Event sourcing support in auth service
- ✅ Bilingual support (Bengali fields) in master data

## Next Steps
1. Create entity files for workflow and rules-engine services
2. Generate migrations for workflow and rules-engine
3. Complete Kafka integration for remaining services
4. Run comprehensive integration tests
5. Verify all services work together in Docker environment

## Time Summary
- Phase 1 (Health Checks): 30 minutes ✅
- Phase 2 (Metrics): 45 minutes ✅
- Phase 3 (Migrations - Auth/Master): 30 minutes ✅
- **Total Completed**: 1 hour 45 minutes
- **Estimated Remaining**: 5 hours

## Files to Update in Next Session
- Create workflow entities: process, task, transition, assignment
- Create rules-engine entities: rule, condition, action, evaluation
- Configure Kafka topics for workflow, rules-engine, api-gateway
- Test complete system with docker-compose
