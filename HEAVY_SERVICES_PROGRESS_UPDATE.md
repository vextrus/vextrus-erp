# Heavy Services Progress Update
**Date:** 2025-09-25
**Session:** Fixing remaining heavy services

## ✅ Major Achievements

### 1. Docker Images Built Successfully
All three heavy dependency services now have Docker images:
- **document-generator:** 1.92GB (Chromium installed) ✅
- **file-storage:** 1.16GB (libvips installed) ✅
- **import-export:** 1.63GB (LibreOffice installed) ✅

### 2. Document Generator Service
- **Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- Running successfully in Docker
- GraphQL endpoint active
- PDF generation with Puppeteer working
- Multi-language font support configured

### 3. File Storage Service
- **Status:** ⚠️ Docker image built, TypeScript fixes needed
- **Issues Fixed:**
  - Duplicate MetricsModule imports removed
  - Controller method signatures aligned
  - Minio package installed
- **Remaining:** 29 TypeScript errors (mostly nullable types)

### 4. Import/Export Service
- **Status:** ⚠️ Docker image built, minor fixes needed
- **Issues Fixed:**
  - Duplicate imports removed
  - @types/multer installed
- **Remaining:** PrometheusModule configuration, migration issues

## 📊 Current Infrastructure Status

| Metric | Initial | Current | Improvement |
|--------|---------|---------|-------------|
| Services Running | 22/39 | 23/39 | +1 service |
| Infrastructure Readiness | 56% | 59% | +3% |
| Heavy Services Docker Images | 0/3 | 3/3 | 100% complete |
| Heavy Services Running | 0/3 | 1/3 | 33% operational |

## 🔑 Key Technical Solutions

### Docker Build Optimization
- Extended timeout to 30 minutes for heavy dependencies
- Multi-stage builds with conditional runtime dependencies
- Successful download and installation of:
  - Chromium (~170MB)
  - LibreOffice (~165MB)
  - libvips for image processing

### TypeScript Fixes Applied
1. Removed duplicate module imports
2. Fixed controller/service method signature mismatches
3. Installed missing type definitions
4. Made nullable types explicit

## 🚀 Next Steps for Full Operation

### Short-term (To get services running)
1. **File-storage:** Fix remaining nullable type errors or build with `skipLibCheck`
2. **Import-export:** Remove PrometheusModule or install dependency
3. Rebuild both services locally
4. Restart Docker containers

### Alternative Quick Fix
```bash
# Build with relaxed TypeScript checking
cd services/file-storage
echo '{ "extends": "./tsconfig.json", "compilerOptions": { "skipLibCheck": true } }' > tsconfig.build.json
pnpm run build

cd ../import-export
echo '{ "extends": "./tsconfig.json", "compilerOptions": { "skipLibCheck": true } }' > tsconfig.build.json
pnpm run build
```

## 📈 Progress Summary

**What Works:**
- ✅ All Docker images successfully built with heavy dependencies
- ✅ Document-generator fully operational
- ✅ Infrastructure for heavy services established
- ✅ Build scripts and Dockerfiles optimized

**What Needs Work:**
- ⚠️ TypeScript compilation errors in file-storage
- ⚠️ Minor configuration issues in import-export
- ⚠️ Services need to be rebuilt and restarted

## 💡 Key Learning

The critical breakthrough was **allowing sufficient build time** (30 minutes) for Docker to download and install large binary dependencies. This patience-based approach successfully resolved the initial blocking issue where builds were timing out after 10 minutes.

---
*Infrastructure improved from 56% to 59% readiness. Document-generator operational. File-storage and import-export have Docker infrastructure ready, pending TypeScript fixes.*
