## Completed Tasks Overview

### 1. ✅ Authentication Guards Implementation (100% Coverage)

Applied `@UseGuards(GqlAuthGuard)` to all sensitive resolvers across 6 microservices:

#### Services with Guards Applied:
- **Auth Service** (3/3 operations) - Already protected
- **Finance Service** (10/10 operations) - ✅ Guards added

- **Master Data Service** (26/26 operations) - Already protected
- **Workflow Service** (All operations) - Already protected (class-level guard)
- **Rules Engine Service** (13/13 operations) - Already protected

#### Implementation Details:

**Finance Service:**

### 4. ✅ Document Generator Health Fix

**Issue:** Health check failing due to:
- Kafka connection taking ~30 seconds during startup
- `start_period: 10s` was too short

**Solution:**
- Updated health check path to use IPv4 (127.0.0.1 instead of localhost)
- Increased `start_period` from 10s to 45s
- Increased `timeout` from 3s to 5s
- Changed method to reliable `wget` command

**File Modified:** `docker-compose.yml` line 427-432

**Health Endpoint Verified:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "info": {
    "database": {"status": "up"},
    "memory_heap": {"status": "up"},
    "memory_rss": {"status": "up"},
    "storage": {"status": "up"}
  }
}
```

### 5. ✅ Windows Port Conflicts Resolution

**Issue:** After Windows restart, Temporal (7233) and Mailhog (1025, 8025) fail to start:
```
ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:7233 -> 127.0.0.1:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:7233: bind: An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions
```

**Root Cause:** Windows reserves ports in dynamic port range (1024-65535) randomly after restart.

**Solution Created:**
- **Script:** `scripts/fix-windows-ports.ps1`
- **Instructions:** `FIX_WINDOWS_PORTS_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**What the Script Does:**
- Checks Administrator privileges
- Excludes 25+ Vextrus ERP ports from Windows dynamic range:
  - 7233 (Temporal)
  - 1025, 8025 (Mailhog)
  - 3001-3018 (All microservices)
  - 4000 (API Gateway)
  - 5432 (PostgreSQL)
  - 6379 (Redis)
  - 9092, 9093 (Kafka)
- Uses `netsh interface ipv4 add excludedportrange` command
- Permanent fix (persists across reboots)

**Next Steps for User:**
1. Run PowerShell as Administrator
2. Execute: `.\scripts\fix-windows-ports.ps1`
3. Restart Docker Desktop
4. Run: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`

## Docker Configuration Updates

### Modified Files:
1. **`docker-compose.yml`**
   - Document Generator health check (line 427-432)

2. **`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`**
   - Mounted alert rules for Prometheus
   - Mounted dashboards for Grafana

3. **`infrastructure/docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml`**
   - Added alert rules reference
