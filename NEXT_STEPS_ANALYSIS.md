## RISK ANALYSIS

### High Risk Areas

1. **Workflow Service Migration to Debian**
   - **Risk:** Debian image 2x larger than Alpine
   - **Mitigation:** Acceptable tradeoff for Temporal SDK compatibility
   - **Impact:** Single service, contained change

2. **Health Endpoint Implementations**
   - **Risk:** 9 services to modify, potential for errors
   - **Mitigation:** Use organization service as proven template
   - **Impact:** Non-breaking changes, can be done incrementally

3. **Backend Validation**
   - **Risk:** May discover new issues during testing
   - **Mitigation:** Already validated build + deploy, mainly verification
   - **Impact:** Documentation and testing, no code changes expected

### Medium Risk Areas

4. **Service Interdependencies**
   - **Risk:** Fixing one service may affect others
   - **Mitigation:** Test each fix in isolation first
   - **Impact:** May require iteration

5. **24-Hour Stability Testing**
   - **Risk:** Services may crash after appearing stable
   - **Mitigation:** Monitor logs, have rollback plan
   - **Impact:** May extend Phase 1 timeline
