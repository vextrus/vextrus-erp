# Session 6: Core Skills Upgrade - Start Here

**Context**: This is a continuation of Session 5 (Skills Integration & Workflow Orchestra). We're 45% complete with upgrading Vextrus ERP's 17-skill ecosystem to full Anthropic best practices compliance.

---

## Session Overview

**Objective**: Complete Core Skills upgrade (execute-first, haiku-explorer, test-first) to match the quality of 8 Advanced Skills that already follow Anthropic best practices.

**Why Critical**: Core Skills are used in 80% of all tasks but currently have only 2-star quality (vs 5-star for Advanced Skills).

**Duration**: 2.5-3 hours

**Status**: Phase 2 complete, Phase 3.1 started (30% complete)

---

## What You Accomplished in Session 5

### ✅ Phase 1: Skills Documentation (100%)
**File**: `.claude/skills/README.md` - Fully updated

**Additions**:
1. Documented all 17 skills (was 11):
   - 3 Core: execute-first, haiku-explorer, test-first
   - 3 Domain: graphql-schema, event-sourcing, security-first
   - 3 Infrastructure: database-migrations, multi-tenancy, production-deployment
   - 8 Advanced: error-handling-observability, performance-caching, service-integration, domain-modeling, integration-testing, nestjs-patterns, api-versioning, health-check-patterns

2. Added Skill Activation Matrix:
   - 10 task types → skills mapping
   - Co-activation frequency data (from 40 tasks)
   - Example: "New CQRS Feature" → 6 skills coordinated

3. Added Skill Relationships & Dependencies:
   - 4-tier hierarchy diagram
   - 8 key dependency mappings
   - Cross-skill integration points

4. Added Decision Tree: "Which Skills to Use?" flowchart

5. Added Progressive Disclosure Strategy:
   - Level 1: Core (3 skills, 1.5k tokens)
   - Level 2: Domain (3 skills, 1.5k tokens)
   - Level 3: Infrastructure (3 skills, 1.5k tokens)
   - Level 4: Advanced (8 skills, 4.5k tokens)
   - Total max: 9k tokens (4.5%), typical: 4-5k tokens (2-2.5%)

### ✅ Phase 2: Parallel Workflow Analysis (100%)
**Launched 3 Explore agents** to analyze:
1. .claude/ directory (skills quality)
2. sessions/ directory (knowledge base)
3. Skill integration patterns

**Critical Findings**:

**Quality Gap**:
| Metric | Core Skills | Advanced Skills | Gap |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----|
| Lines | 170 avg | 485 avg | -65% |
| Resources | 0.67 avg | 3.0 avg | -78% |
| Patterns | 1 avg | 7 avg | -85% |
| auto_load_knowledge | 0% | 100% | -100% |
| Quality Rating | 2/5 | 5/5 | -60% |

**Anthropic Pattern Discovered** (by analyzing 8 Advanced Skills):
- **Gold Standard**: health-check-patterns.md (661 lines) - perfect Anthropic compliance
- **Template Structure**: 500+ lines, 7-10 patterns, evidence-based, best practices + anti-patterns
- **Frontmatter**: version, triggers array, auto_load_knowledge
- **Resources**: 3 files per skill, ~300 lines each
- **Knowledge Integration**: Auto-loads patterns from sessions/knowledge/

**Integration Status**:
- 11/17 skills (65%) have auto_load_knowledge
- All 8 Advanced Skills (100%) have integration
- 0/3 Core Skills (0%) have integration ← **CRITICAL PROBLEM**
- Missing: 3 pattern files need creation

### ⏳ Phase 3.1: execute-first Upgrade (30%)
**Started Core Skills upgrade**

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created `.claude/skills/execute-first/resources/` directory
- ✅ Created `execution-strategies.md` resource (first of 3)
  - 3 strategies: Quick-Win (80%), Feature (15%), Complex (5%)
  - Decision tree, evidence from 40+ tasks
  - Integration with other skills

**Remaining** (45 min):
- Create `code-first-patterns.md` resource (15 min)
- Create `skill-coordination.md` resource (15 min)
- Upgrade execute-first SKILL.md from 93 → 500+ lines (30 min)
- Create `execute-first-patterns.md` knowledge file (15 min)
