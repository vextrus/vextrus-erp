## I. Core Philosophy

### Execute First, Document Later
```
Code > Plans > Docs
Working Software > Comprehensive Documentation
Learning > Following Rules
```

### Dual-Model Strategy
```
Haiku 4.5 (73% SWE-bench)    →  Exploration, Context, Analysis
Sonnet 4.5 (77% SWE-bench)   →  Implementation, Complex Logic
```

### Skills-Driven Development
```
6 Skills Auto-Activate:
├─ execute-first        → "implement", "fix", "add"
├─ haiku-explorer       → "where", "find", "understand"
├─ test-first           → "test", "TDD", financial calculations
├─ graphql-schema       → "graphql", "schema", "resolver"
├─ event-sourcing       → "aggregate", "event", "CQRS"
└─ security-first       → "security", "auth", "validation"
```

---

## II. Daily Workflow (80% of Tasks)

### Simple Tasks (<1 day, <100 lines)

```bash
# 1. Quick Exploration (30 seconds, Haiku 4.5)
/explore services/finance

# 2. Direct Execution (Sonnet 4.5)
# Skills auto-activate based on your prompt:
# "implement invoice validation"  → execute-first skill
# "add test for payment"          → test-first skill
# "where is auth guard"           → haiku-explorer skill

# 3. Quality Gates (2-5 minutes)
/review /test /security-scan

# 4. Git Commit (30 seconds)
git add . && git commit -m "feat: invoice validation"
```

**Total Time**: 1-4 hours
**Model Distribution**: 90% Sonnet, 10% Haiku
**Context Usage**: <30k tokens (15%)

---

## III. Complex Workflow (20% of Tasks)

### Compounding Cycle (Multi-day features)

#### Phase 1: PLAN (1-3 hours, Sonnet orchestrates)
```
1. [Haiku] /explore services/[affected-services] (parallel, 2-3 agents)
2. [Sonnet] Launch specialized agents:
   - architecture-strategist    → System design
   - pattern-recognition-specialist → Existing patterns
   - best-practices-researcher  → External research
   - database-architect         → Schema design (if needed)
   - graphql-architect          → GraphQL schema (if needed)
3. [Sonnet] Create SpecKit feature spec (sessions/specs/[feature].md)
```

**Output**: Comprehensive feature specification
**Time**: 1-3 hours
**Agent Limit**: 3-5 agents max

#### Phase 2: DELEGATE (2-8 hours wall-clock, parallel execution)
```
1. [Sonnet] Break spec into subtasks (TodoWrite: 5-15 items)
2. [Haiku] Execute subtasks in parallel (2-5 agents):
   - Agent 1: Backend domain logic
   - Agent 2: GraphQL resolvers
   - Agent 3: Frontend components
   - Agent 4: Database migrations
   - Agent 5: Integration tests
3. [Sonnet] Monitor progress, coordinate integration
```

**Output**: Working feature implementation
**Time**: 2-5x faster than sequential
**Speed**: Parallel execution (2-5 Haiku agents)

#### Phase 3: ASSESS (30 min - 2 hours, quality compounding)
```
Level 1: Automated (5 minutes)
├─ /review
├─ /security-scan
├─ /test
└─ pnpm build

Level 2: Language-Specific (10-30 minutes)
└─ kieran-typescript-reviewer (for TS/React)

Level 3: Specialized (15-45 minutes, if needed)
├─ performance-oracle        → Performance analysis
├─ security-sentinel         → Security audit
└─ data-integrity-guardian   → Database safety

Level 4: Domain-Specific (15-30 minutes)
├─ Bangladesh compliance     → VAT, TIN, Mushak-6.3
├─ GraphQL Federation        → Entity keys, directives
└─ Event Sourcing            → Versioning, idempotency
```

**Output**: Production-ready quality
**Time**: 30 min - 2 hours depending on complexity

#### Phase 4: CODIFY (15-45 minutes, learning capture)
```
1. [Sonnet] Launch feedback-codifier agent
   Questions answered:
   - What patterns worked well?
   - What could be simplified?
   - What should be automated?
   - What was hard to understand?
   - What would help future similar tasks?

2. [Sonnet] Update knowledge base:
   - services/[name]/CLAUDE.md  → Service-specific patterns
   - sessions/knowledge/vextrus-erp/workflow-patterns.md
   - memory/patterns.md         → Project-wide patterns
```

**Output**: Accumulated learnings for next task
**Compounding Effect**: Each task 20-40% faster

---

## IV. Skill Activation Strategy

### Automatic Trigger Patterns

#### 1. Execute First Skill
```
Triggers: "implement", "fix", "add", "update", "refactor", "build", "create"

Auto-behavior:
1. TodoWrite (3-5 items, under 10 lines)
2. Direct code execution (Write/Edit)
3. Tests immediately
4. Mark done
5. NO markdown docs unless user requests
```

**When**: 80% of tasks
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Time Saved**: 50% (no planning overhead)

#### 2. Haiku Explorer Skill
```
Triggers: "where", "find", "understand", "how does", "what is", "explore"

Auto-behavior:
1. Launch Task with subagent_type=Explore
2. Use Haiku 4.5 (2x faster, 1/3 cost)
3. Return structured analysis
4. Minimal context usage
```

**When**: Before EVERY complex task
**Model**: Haiku 4.5
**Savings**: 98.6% context, 67% cost

#### 3. Test-First Skill
```
Triggers: "test", "TDD", financial calculations, payment processing

Auto-behavior:
1. Write failing test FIRST
2. Minimal implementation to pass
3. Refactor for quality
4. Repeat for next test
```

**When**: Critical financial logic, business rules
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Quality**: 95%+ test coverage

#### 4. GraphQL Schema Skill
```
Triggers: "graphql", "schema", "resolver", "query", "mutation", "federation"

Auto-behavior:
1. Check existing schema patterns (entity keys)
2. Validate Federation v2 directives
3. Ensure pagination patterns
4. Mutation payload structure
```

**When**: API development across 18 services
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Consistency**: 100% Federation v2 compliance

#### 5. Event Sourcing Skill
```
Triggers: "aggregate", "event", "domain", "CQRS", "command"

2. RBAC guard verification
3. Input validation (class-validator)
4. SQL injection prevention
```

**When**: Auth flows, data mutations, financial operations
**Model**: Sonnet 4.5
**Security**: Production-grade

### Multi-Skill Coordination

**Example**: Implementing invoice payment flow
```
User: "implement invoice payment with validation"

Skills activated:
1. execute-first        → Direct implementation
2. test-first           → TDD for payment logic
3. graphql-schema       → Payment mutation schema
4. event-sourcing       → PaymentProcessed event
5. security-first       → RBAC on payment endpoint

Execution flow:
1. [Haiku] /explore services/finance (haiku-explorer)
2. [Sonnet] Write failing test (test-first)
3. [Sonnet] Implement Payment aggregate (event-sourcing)
4. [Sonnet] Create GraphQL mutation (graphql-schema)
5. [Sonnet] Add RBAC guard (security-first)
6. [Sonnet] Run tests → green (execute-first)
7. [Sonnet] /security-scan (security-first)
```

## VI. Context Optimization Strategy

### Reference > Embed Pattern

**❌ Don't Embed**:
```markdown
Task file should NOT contain:
- Full architecture diagrams (500+ lines)
- Complete entity definitions
- Entire GraphQL schemas
- Full migration files
```

**✅ Do Reference**:
```markdown
Task file SHOULD reference:
- See: services/finance/CLAUDE.md (domain patterns)
- See: services/finance/src/domain/entities/ (entity definitions)
- Use: /explore services/finance/src/domain (live analysis)
```

**Target**: Task files <500 lines (optimal), max 1,000 lines

### MCP On-Demand Strategy

**Default Enabled** (1.5k tokens, 0.7% context):
```
- sequential-thinking: Complex problem analysis
```

**Enable When Needed**:
```
@postgres     → Database operations
@docker       → Container debugging
@github       → PR/issue management
@serena       → Advanced code search
```

**Savings**: 98.6% context reduction (109.5k tokens reclaimed)

### Task State Synchronization

**Lightweight State** (`.claude/state/current_task.json`):
```json
{
  "task": "i-finance-module-refinement-production-ready",
  "branch": "feature/finance-production-refinement",
  "services": ["finance", "auth", "api-gateway", "web"],
  "phase": "Phase 1: Security Hardening",
  "day": "Day 1 Complete (85%)",
  "complexity": 52,
  "critical_issues_remaining": [...]
}
```

**Rich State** (`sessions/tasks/[task-name].md`):
- Work log (concise, daily summaries)
- Phase progress
- Blockers and resolutions
- Decisions made
- References to code/docs

---

## VII. Quality Gates & Standards

### Automated Gates (Non-Negotiable)
```bash
/review           # Code quality, patterns, consistency
/security-scan    # SAST analysis, vulnerabilities
/test             # Unit + integration tests
pnpm build        # TypeScript compilation
```

**Time**: 2-5 minutes
**Fail = Block**: Cannot commit if any fail

### Advanced Reviews (Medium/Complex Tasks)
```
architecture-strategist     → System design validation
kieran-typescript-reviewer  → Code quality (TS strictness)
performance-oracle          → Performance bottlenecks
security-sentinel           → Security audit
data-integrity-guardian     → Database safety
```

**Time**: 15-45 minutes
**Trigger**: Complexity >30, multi-service changes

### Domain-Specific Validation
```
Bangladesh ERP Compliance:
- VAT rates (15%, 7.5%, 5%)
- TIN/BIN validation
- Mushak-6.3 format
- Fiscal year (July-June)

GraphQL Federation v2:
- @key directives on entities
- @shareable for shared fields
- Pagination (edges/nodes pattern)
- Error handling (errors field in payload)

Event Sourcing:
- Event versioning (v1, v2...)
- Idempotency keys
- Replay safety
- Aggregate version tracking
```

**Time**: 15-30 minutes
**Trigger**: Finance, CRM, HR services

### Performance Standards
```
API Endpoints:  <300ms (good), <500ms (acceptable)
DB Queries:     <100ms (good), <250ms (acceptable)
Page Loads:     <2s (good), <3s (acceptable)
```

---

## VIII. Agent Usage Guidelines

### Agent Limit: <3 per task

**Use Agents For**:
- Security-critical changes (security-sentinel)
- Performance optimization (performance-oracle)
- Architecture decisions (architecture-strategist)
- Refactoring >500 lines (code-reviewer)
- Complex pattern extraction (pattern-recognition-specialist)

**Skip Agents For**:
- Simple features (<100 lines) → Skills handle it
- Bug fixes → Direct execution
- CRUD operations → Execute-first skill
- Test writing → Test-first skill

### Parallel Agent Execution

**When Settings Allow** (no blocking hooks):
```
Single message, multiple Task calls:

[Sonnet] Launch 3 Haiku agents in parallel:
- Agent 1: Explore .claude directory
- Agent 2: Explore sessions workflow
- Agent 3: Explore service architecture

Result: 3x faster than sequential
```

**Limitations**:
- Agent output limit: 8192 tokens (set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16384`)
- Focus prompts to stay under limit
- Use for exploration, not code generation

---

## IX. Git Workflow Integration

### Branch Strategy
```
feature/[task-name]         → New features
fix/[issue-name]            → Bug fixes
experiment/[name]           → Research
```

### Commit Standards
```bash
# Conventional commits
feat: add invoice payment flow
fix: resolve authentication bypass
refactor: simplify event sourcing pattern
test: add payment validation tests
docs: update finance service CLAUDE.md

# Include task reference
feat(finance): invoice payment

Implements payment processing with event sourcing.
- Payment aggregate with CQRS
- GraphQL mutation with RBAC
- Integration tests

Task: i-finance-module-refinement-production-ready
Phase: 2, Day 5
```

### Quality Gates Before Commit
```
1. /review /test /security-scan → All pass
2. pnpm build → Success
3. Advanced reviews (if needed)
4. Domain validations complete
5. THEN: git add . && git commit
```

---

## X. Knowledge Base & Compounding

### Systematic Learning Capture

## XIII. Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Increase agent output limit (from 8192 to 16384)
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16384

# Enable cost tracking (optional)
export CLAUDE_CODE_TRACK_COSTS=true
```

### Settings Verification
```bash
# Minimal settings (schema reference only)
cat .claude/settings.json
# Should show:
# {
#   "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json"
# }

# Verify no hooks enabled
grep -q "hooks" .claude/settings.json && echo "HOOKS FOUND - REMOVE" || echo "✅ No hooks"

# Verify skills present
ls .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md
# Should show 6 skills
```

### Restart Verification
```
After Claude Code restart:
1. Skills should auto-load (check descriptions work)
2. Parallel agents should execute (test with 3 /explore commands)
3. No hook overhead (instant tool execution)
```

---

## XIV. Troubleshooting

### Agent Output Truncation
```
Error: "Claude's response exceeded 8192 output token maximum"

Solution:
export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16384

Or refocus agent prompts to be more specific
```

### Skills Not Activating
```
Issue: Skills don't trigger on expected keywords

Solutions:
1. Restart Claude Code (skills load at startup)
2. Check .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md frontmatter exists
3. Verify description field includes trigger words
4. Test with explicit trigger: "implement [feature]"
```

### Context Bloat
```
Issue: Approaching 200k token limit

Solutions:
1. Apply context-compaction protocol
2. Refactor task file to <500 lines
3. Use reference pattern (not embed)
4. Enable MCPs on-demand only
5. Create checkpoint and reset
```

### Parallel Agents Fail
```
Issue: "tool use concurrency issues" 400 error

Solutions:
1. Verify no hooks in .claude/settings.json
2. Check hooks section is empty or missing
3. Restart Claude Code after removing hooks
```
