  - Configure failure notifications

### 8. Configure Code Coverage Reporting
- **Status**: PARTIAL - vitest.config.ts has coverage config
- **Existing Configuration**:
  - Provider: v8
  - Reporters: text, json, html, lcov
  - Thresholds: 80% (lines, functions, branches, statements)
  - Excludes: node_modules, test files, stories, config files
- **Remaining Actions**:
  - Generate coverage reports
  - Upload coverage to service (Codecov/Coveralls)
  - Add coverage badges to README
  - Configure CI to enforce thresholds
  - Set up quality gates

- ‚úÖ Browser mode with Playwright
- ‚úÖ Coverage configuration
- ‚úÖ Path aliases
- ‚úÖ Timeouts configured

### package.json Scripts

  "test": "vitest",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:run": "vitest run",
  "test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
  "test:browser": "VITEST_BROWSER=true vitest",

}
```

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Complete remaining story tests** (29 components)
   - Can be done systematically following the established pattern
   - Consider creating a generator script for efficiency

2. **Set up Playwright E2E tests**
   - Create playwright.config.ts
   - Add 2-3 example E2E tests
   - Document E2E testing patterns

### Medium Priority
3. **GitHub Actions CI/CD**
   - Create test workflow
   - Integrate with PR process
   - Add coverage reporting

4. **Coverage reporting**
   - Generate initial coverage report
   - Identify gaps
   - Set realistic thresholds

### Low Priority
5. **Breadcrumbs and Sidebar story issues**
   - User noted but asked to proceed with Phase 3
   - Investigate after core testing infrastructure complete

## Blockers and Risks

### Current Blockers
- None

### Risks
1. **Story test generation time** - Manual creation of 29 story tests could be time-consuming
   - **Mitigation**: Create generator script or parallelize work

2. **Coverage threshold enforcement** - Current 80% threshold may be too high initially
   - **Mitigation**: Start with lower thresholds and gradually increase

3. **E2E test flakiness** - Browser-based tests can be flaky
   - **Mitigation**: Use Playwright best practices, proper waits, and retries

## Success Metrics

### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [x] Vitest browser mode configured and working
- [x] composeStories pattern established and documented
- [ ] Story tests for all 32 components (3/32 complete)
- [ ] Playwright configured and example E2E tests created
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow running tests
- [ ] Code coverage reporting functional with quality gates

### Target Metrics
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% ‚úÖ (81/81 tests passing)
- **Story Test Coverage**: 100% (currently 9.4%)
- **Code Coverage**: 80% (threshold configured, not yet measured)
- **CI Build Time**: < 5 minutes (to be measured)
- **E2E Test Count**: Minimum 5 critical flows (0 currently)
