### Scenario 4: Invoice List ❌ FAILED
**Status:** FAILED - CORS Error
**Screenshot:** `.playwright-mcp/scenario-4-invoice-list-CORS-ERROR.png`

**Steps Tested:**
1. Navigate to /finance/invoices
2. Verify page loads
3. Check GraphQL query execution

**Result:**
- Page loaded successfully (UI rendered)
- GraphQL query FAILED with CORS error
- Error message displayed: "Failed to load invoices: Failed to fetch"

**Console Errors:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:4000/graphql' from origin 'http://localhost:3010' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.

[Network error]: TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

**Root Cause:**
- API Gateway CORS configuration not properly set for http://localhost:3010
- Previous CORS fix did not take effect or was not applied correctly
- Backend needs to allow origin: http://localhost:3010

**Blocker:** CRITICAL - No Finance data can be loaded without fixing CORS

---

### Scenario 5: Chart of Accounts ❌ FAILED
**Status:** FAILED - Authorization Error
**Screenshot:** `.playwright-mcp/scenario-5-chart-of-accounts-UNAUTHORIZED.png`

**Steps Tested:**
1. Navigate to /finance/accounts
2. Verify page access

**Result:**
- Redirected to /unauthorized page
- Error message: "Access Denied - You don't have permission to access this page."

**Console Errors:**
- No GraphQL errors (didn't reach that point)
- Page-level authorization check failed

**Root Cause:**
- RBAC guard blocking access to Chart of Accounts
- User role is "None" (seen in dashboard)
- Insufficient permissions for this resource

**Blocker:** HIGH - RBAC configuration needs review

---

### Scenario 6: Payments ❌ BLOCKED
**Status:** BLOCKED - Session Expired

**Console Errors:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 (Service Unavailable)
http://localhost:3010/api/auth/me

Failed to refresh user: Error: Failed to fetch user session
```

**Root Cause:**
- Auth API route (/api/auth/me) returning 503 Service Unavailable
- Session refresh mechanism failing
- Backend auth service may be down or misconfigured

**Blocker:** MEDIUM - Session management needs fixing

---

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. CORS Configuration (CRITICAL - P0)
**Issue:** GraphQL requests from Next.js frontend blocked by CORS policy

**Evidence:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:4000/graphql' from origin 'http://localhost:3010'
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Impact:**
- No Finance module data can be loaded
- All GraphQL queries fail
- Complete blocker for frontend-backend integration

**Required Fix:**
- Update API Gateway CORS configuration to allow origin: `http://localhost:3010`
- Ensure CORS headers include:
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3010`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type, authorization`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, OPTIONS`

**File to Check:** `C:\Users\riz\vextrus-erp\services\api-gateway\src\main.ts`

---

### 2. RBAC/Authorization Issue (HIGH - P1)
**Issue:** Chart of Accounts page redirects to /unauthorized

**Evidence:**
- User role shows as "None" in dashboard
- Page access denied despite successful authentication

**Impact:**
- Certain Finance pages inaccessible
- RBAC guards may be too restrictive for development

**Required Fix:**
- Review RBAC configuration in Finance service
- Assign proper role to test user (admin@vextrus.com)
- Or temporarily disable RBAC guards for development environment

**Files to Check:**
- `C:\Users\riz\vextrus-erp\services\finance\src\infrastructure\guards\rbac.guard.ts`
- Finance service RBAC decorator usage

---

### 3. Session Management (MEDIUM - P2)
**Issue:** Auth endpoint /api/auth/me returning 503 errors

**Evidence:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 503 (Service Unavailable)
http://localhost:3010/api/auth/me
```

**Impact:**
- Session expires unexpectedly
- User redirected to login during navigation
- Poor user experience

**Required Fix:**
- Verify Auth service is running and healthy
- Check Next.js API route configuration
- Review session refresh mechanism

**File to Check:** `C:\Users\riz\vextrus-erp\apps\web\src\app\api\auth\me\route.ts`

---

## Additional Observations

### Console Warnings (Non-blocking)
```
- 404: /site.webmanifest (PWA manifest missing)
- 404: /favicon.ico (favicon missing)
- 404: /fonts/NotoSansBengali-Regular.woff2 (font preload)
- 404: /favicon-16x16.png
```
These are minor UI polish issues, not functional blockers.

### Web Vitals Performance
```
FCP: 5408ms (poor) - First Contentful Paint
LCP: 8428ms (poor) - Largest Contentful Paint
TTFB: 5295ms (poor) - Time to First Byte
INP: 40ms (good) - Interaction to Next Paint
CLS: 0.026 (good) - Cumulative Layout Shift
```
Performance metrics show slow initial load times.

## GraphQL Connectivity Status

**Status:** ❌ FAILED

**Expected:** GraphQL queries from frontend (http://localhost:3010) successfully reach backend (http://localhost:4000/graphql)

**Actual:** All GraphQL requests blocked by CORS policy

**CORS Fix Status:**
- Previous session attempted to fix CORS in `services/api-gateway/src/main.ts`
- Fix either:
  1. Was not applied correctly
  2. Did not restart API Gateway
  3. Needs additional configuration

**Action Required:**
1. Verify API Gateway is running with latest code
2. Check CORS configuration includes `http://localhost:3010`
3. Restart API Gateway service: `cd services/api-gateway && pnpm dev`
4. Test GraphQL endpoint directly with curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:4000/graphql \
     -H "Origin: http://localhost:3010" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
     -v
   ```

---

## Next Steps - Priority Order

### Immediate (Session 4)
1. **Fix CORS Configuration (P0)**
   - Verify/update API Gateway CORS settings
   - Restart API Gateway service
   - Test with curl to confirm CORS headers
   - Re-run Scenario 4 to verify fix

2. **Fix RBAC/Authorization (P1)**
   - Review Finance service RBAC guards
   - Assign proper role to test user OR disable guards for dev
   - Re-run Scenario 5 to verify access

3. **Fix Session Management (P2)**
   - Debug /api/auth/me endpoint
   - Ensure Auth service connectivity
   - Re-run Scenario 6 to verify session stability

### Follow-up (Session 5)
4. Test Journal Entries page (not tested in this session)
5. Test full CRUD operations on working pages
6. Performance optimization for slow load times
7. Fix minor UI issues (favicons, manifests)

## Success Criteria Evaluation

**Target:** At least 4/6 scenarios PASSED
**Actual:** 3/6 scenarios PASSED

**Verdict:** ⚠️ Below target - Critical blockers prevent full integration

**Blockers Identified:**
- ✅ All working pages captured with screenshots
- ✅ All error scenarios documented
- ✅ Clear next steps identified

---

## Recommendations

### For Development Team:
1. **Establish CORS Standards**
   - Document all allowed origins for each environment
   - Automate CORS configuration in environment files
   - Add CORS validation to CI/CD pipeline

2. **RBAC Development Mode**
   - Create "dev-admin" role with all permissions
   - Add environment variable to bypass RBAC in local dev
   - Document permission requirements for each endpoint

3. **Session Health Monitoring**
   - Add health check for Auth service
   - Implement session refresh retry logic
   - Add better error messaging for auth failures

4. **Integration Testing**
   - Add automated E2E tests to CI/CD
   - Test CORS configuration in deployment pipeline
   - Validate GraphQL connectivity before deployment

---

## Previous Session Context

**Session 2 Results:**
- 2/6 scenarios completed
- Same CORS issue identified
- Attempted fix in api-gateway/src/main.ts

**Session 3 Changes:**
- Full 6 scenario test run completed
- Additional authorization issue discovered
- Session management issue identified
- Comprehensive blocker documentation

**Comparison:**
- Session 2: CORS identified but not fully tested
- Session 3: CORS confirmed as blocker + 2 new issues found

---

## Conclusion

This testing session successfully identified THREE critical blockers preventing full frontend-backend integration:

1. **CORS Configuration** - Highest priority, blocks all data loading
2. **RBAC Authorization** - Blocks certain Finance pages
3. **Session Management** - Causes unexpected logouts

**Status:** Frontend UI is functional, but backend connectivity is blocked. Once CORS is fixed, expect rapid progress on remaining scenarios.

**Next Session Goal:** Fix all 3 blockers and achieve 6/6 scenarios PASSED.
